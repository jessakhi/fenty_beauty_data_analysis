Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Love the lipstain - I have the purple one and would definitely buy more if they bought out some nude shades or a cool-toned red. 

The liquid Stunna lipstick is also amazing but you need to know the trick to getting it to stay put, which is using literally the bare minimum of product. I used it like a normal liquid lipstick for the first few tries and it got EVERY WHERE. My chin, my hands, my clothes, door handles, walls. I ended up googling if there was something I was missing about how to apply it and found a video they posted by Priscilla, Rihanna’s makeup artist which shows her wiping the applicator until there’s barely anything left on it and then applying to lips. Good makeup shouldn’t need to come with an instruction manual IMO but it’s a great product with that aside. 

I’ve tried the Matte liquid foundation and agree that it does oxidise but I have recently found out I was buying the wrong shade so I would give it another go in my actual shade.

Makeup,Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation,">I like my current foundation, but I guess I'm always on the lookout for something even better lol.

I think this mindset is how I ended up with the Fenty foundation TBH! 😂

I've used higher-end and drugstore foundations, and honestly, I always tend to go back to L'Oreal. I'm currently using their True Match foundation, but I've used their Infallible line before and really liked it (but not the super matte one that comes in a tube).

As of more recently on the higher-end, I've tried NARS Radiant Longwear and did not like it. Didn't last at all and their color formulations tend to lean a little too cool. I've also tried their concealer which I feel somehow had less coverage than that foundation, and Orgasm blush was way too sparkly. I've sworn myself off that brand, lol.

On the lower end, Elf is not great. I feel like people like it because of the price point, but there's something noticeably off about all of their foundation/concealer color formulations, and their lip/eye products lack pigment.

I don't think higher-end is bad or anything, but for my day-to-day wear, there's not enough of a difference for me to pay the extra cost. I'm pretty happy with the quality of foundation and concealer from both L'Oreal and Milani.

The gloss has a scent which I was wary of because I'm very sensitive to scents but it doesn't bother me and the effect is beautiful. It smooths over lips and gives a really pretty plump look and it works great over liners and lipsticks as well it is also very conditioning. Ive used it all day for about 4 days and each time it lasted until I wiped it off and left my lips feeling like I used a nice lip treatment.

The only thing I didn't like from the line from playing around at Sephora (I've gone there three times since the launch and always play around with the products and I make sure to get colour matched each time just to see if a different Sales Associate matches me to a different shade) is the concealer sticks.

The contour colour was fine though and wore nicely, but I won't buy it because I recently bought the Smashbox contour/foundation duo stick.

Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,"I have this foundation (use it for work) and have repurchased it.  I always do major skin prep for any high coverage matte foundation.   I use a very hydrating moisturizer (cerave) and hydrating primer (Fenty).  Sometimes I’ll mix the foundation and primer together for a bb cream look.  Then I use a damp sponge to apply a thin layer.  then i add an extra layer over parts i need more coverage.   This will help with the non matching color.  BTW with matte long lasting foundations, going in too thick will result in looking patchy, streaky, and all that.  Best to do layers.  then apply very thin layer of powder over my oily bits.

- [Laura Mercier Oil-Free Tinted Moisturizer](https://www.sephora.com/product/tinted-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-oil-free-P140906) and [Laura Mercier Pure Canvas Blurring Primer](https://www.sephora.com/product/laura-mercier-pure-canvas-primer-blurring-floutant-P454941). The shade 1N2 Vanille is a good match for me (it pulls cool) and the primer is a decent mattifying base. I use the [Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage Duo Stick Concealer](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/secret-camouflage-correct-and-brighten-concealer-duo-stick/5736361) in both 1C and 2C depending on the time of year, however Sephora doesn’t carry it anymore and I have to go to Nordstrom to pick it up. Top it all off with some [Laura Mercier Ultra-Blur Setting Powder](https://www.sephora.com/product/ultra-blur-translucent-loose-setting-powder-P500622) and I’m good to go.

- recently I’ve been using and loving the [Carpe Sweat-Absorbing Mattifying Primer](https://mycarpe.com/products/face-primer-spf-30). I saw it on Instagram, which I’m usually super against, and was compelled to try it because not only am I super oily, I also have the wild talent of sweating profusely for no fucking reason. It’s AMAZING. It’s matte but not inhumanly so, absorbs 90% of my sweat (and my days are spent running around in the sun carrying things), has SPF 30, and is super easy to work with. It also pairs nicely with my [Armani Luminous Silk Foundation](https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-foundation-P393401) and [Armani Luminous Silk Concealer](https://www.sephora.com/product/giorgio-armani-beauty-luminous-silk-concealer-P456158) in shades 5.1 and 4.75, respectively.

I tried the concealer and it was alright, but I saw videos where guys literally covered up facial hair with the foundation and that kinda makes me want to try it. Have you tried Sephora color IQ?
