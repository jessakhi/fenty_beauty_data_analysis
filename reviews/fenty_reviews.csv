Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I find their foundations too orange for me and they oxidize a lot unfortunately.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,A nightmare for dry and sensitive skin.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Appropriately hyped imo, I know so many people who could not find their shade until Fenty released. I really like their Eaze drops, hydrating foundation, and contour sticks. They have one highlighter that's worth it to me. The killawatt. "
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Not great. Don't like the gloss, matte foundation, or highlighter duos."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"The eyeliners suck for me. Slightly hooded and very oily eyelids. The cleansers smells gross. The eyeshadows are patchy and don’t blend well. The lip products are amazing. Lipstunnas and heat products, so awesome."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Their glosses are too die for, I haven’t used much else from it"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I love the lip stain (white triangular tube) and am wishing for more shades to be released!
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Love the lip products and a contour stick I got through Ipsy but the eyeshadow palettes I have are really patchy and lackluster.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I think that Fenty is way overhyped. I've tried their cream blush that I liked initially but it went bad in like two months, their plumping lip gloss is just ok, and I hated the skin tint. I'm done buying from the brand"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I've only used their gloss and it's great.  but it's really just another celeb brand made in the same factory with the same ingredients as other brands just with a celeb brand slapped on it.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Overhyped IMO. I hate the foundation. 
I do want to try the how many carats highlighter though. 👀"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I found her foundation too cakey. My mom who has oily/combination skin likes it, but it looked horrible on me. As much as I wanted to like her lip gloss, the smell was too much for me. If the company makes a scentless product, it would be a great lip gloss."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I love the lip glosses and highlighters, the other stuff doesn’t do it for me."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Overrated
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"i'm a WOC, and I've never been tempted to try the brand."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"The powders don’t work for me (they changed the color of the foundation or SOMETHING idk) and the foundation shading range isn’t adequate for neutral folks. Labeled as neutral but it isn’t. I like their lip, glitter cheek stuff, and liner/ mascara. It actually shows up on my skin beautifully. It’s not under or over hyped. It works for some and doesn’t work for others."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I’ve tried the skin tints (liquid and stick version), powder bronzer, and a couple lip products. I ended up giving the lip products to a friend, they were alright but I realized I never gravitated to them, same as the powder bronzer. The skin tints, both versions, I am obsessed with! The liquid is my preferred daily one (I think I’m on my 3rd bottle), but I like the stick for traveling or in a hurry. Besides those, which I will forever keep buying, nothing else calls out to me from them."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I love their glosses and their cream contour/bronzer sticks. Also love their highlighters. Some things are good and worth the hype, some things are not"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Great shade range, great marketing but the foundations clog my pores 😭"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"In my experience there have been many cases where I had high expectations, or a positive initial impression with a Fenty product, only to later feel let down. The Eaze Drop foundation seemed really nice in the store, and looked like a perfect match, only to oxidise orange and make my skin flaky once I’d bought it. The compact contour in Amber was a great contour shade for me and I really liked it, as there aren’t many cool-toned contour options available, but it’s just not blendable at all and I found the ELF putty bronzer in Feelin’ Shady and the contour wand in Fair-Light much better-performing *and* more affordable. I really liked the colour of the Icon Velvet liquid lipstick in HBIC, but it was *extremely* messy to apply because it was an extremely smudgy formula that happened to have extremely high pigmentation, and it dried out my lips. I’ve used similar Korean liquid lipsticks that are a fraction of the cost and are far more elegant to use."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Overhyped imo.

I’ve got pretty dry sensitive skin, though, so keep this in mind.

I just find most of the products drying, or not necessarily bad, just not the greatest. It’s a sort of ‘fenty has an okay product, but someone else always has something better’ type of thing.

The only product I genuinely enjoy is possibly the lip gloss, but even at that I’m not really wowed. I have a Maybelline glass that’s the exact same but less sticky."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,The hella thicc mascara is in my rotation but I probably wouldn’t buy it again once this one runs out
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I'm on the fence about them.  Sure, I like the products, but not that much."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I’ve only used a few of the lip products, but they were just okay imo. Not awful, but not the best in the world either. And this is extremely petty, but I just don’t like Rihanna, so that’s also kind of a meh for me lol."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Lipstick formulas are bad
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Fenty puts fragrance in *all* of their products—even mascara. Why do my eyes need perfume? Anyone with sensitive skin has to steer well clear of this brand.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Its okay. I love how the brand started the flossy glossy and made my fiancé use lip balm that he badly needed.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"My holy grail eyeliner, but besides that and the glosses, I’ve never tried or been particularly drawn to anything else."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,The lipgloss is good and the perfume. That’s all.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I have found everything to be “fine.” But not worthwhile. Other brands have products that I would rather spend my money one wether it be cheaper or not
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I liked their hydrating foundation (good colour match for me) and the setting powder - shame mine separated and expired before I could use it all (Covid). 

I did not like the old concealer - very drying - and the shade sticks (contour, blush and highlight) - also very drying.

I’m wanting to try the ease drop stick and a long lasting lipstick but waiting until I finish a few things first."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I remembered when Fenty was first launched and it showed a lot of other high street brands that it was possible to have a wide foundation shade range. The lip gloss and highlighters were also very popular for a long time, and really fitted into the glam makeup style of that time.

That said, I've not purchased any of her products out of a personal decision."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I like the foundation, and I have a lip gloss, but its honestly no better than any other brand- in that they have some good products, some meh and some terrible."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Meh 
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I’ve only tried the diamond highlighter and lip gloss, and while it’s beautiful, the makeup fell right out of the compact so I have to be super careful with the highlighter, as for the gloss it pealed and looks horrible now. I can’t speak to the past couple years if anything has changed or any of the other products though. The packaging def does not last, but if that’s not a concerning factor for you, then it’s fine."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I adore their lip bomb glosses
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I haven’t found a product I don’t like yet! In the lightest shade of pasty white with combination skin. It’s the only foundation that’s worked for me, I’m assisted to the gloss and I love the contour stick"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"The foundation I tried had separated and horrible on me.  IMO, overhyped."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I have loved everything I've tried from Fenty, I feel like the brand made a big impact on makeup a few years ago and has since slowed down. I'd love to see them be more innovative again"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Over hyped - rare beauty is generally better IMO for that price point and if you want to go up in price a little manyyyy other brands are better
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Cream bronzers & blushes are fantastic. They also have a properly cool toned contour colour (‘amber’)
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I just tried out the cream bronzer in an ulta the other day and oh my lord it was perfect. I say it’s hyped up for a reason!
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Appropriately hyped. Note that its under LVMH so quality is assured. Also its one of the more mid end affordable brands in sephora in my country so really win win situation. Appreciate the shade diversity too
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"It’s on the BDS list, so that’s a no from me dog."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I have oily combo skin and the matte foundation is great for me
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,At first the foundation worked great for the first week but then I started to get mad breakouts on my face and I had to go though trial and error and and realized it was the foundation breaking me out so bad 😭😭😭
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Love love love the mascara hella thick. It’s $20 but yes it’s worth it and love the skin tint stick. Don’t love the cream blush because it would disappear after a couple hours even with setting spray. Haven’t tried anything else yet.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I like the eaze drop skin tint and illuminator a lot.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Obsessed! Gorgeous lip glosses and lip stains, beautiful highlighters, large shade range for foundations and concealers, and the BEST mascara I’ve ever used"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I really like their lip stains
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I like the lip glosses, blush and the foundation stick"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I used to be pretty skeptical of it, as I tend to be with celebrity brands, but I’ve actually grown to really like it. I have dry skin but I’m really about my skincare / skin prep and I have never had their pro filt’r foundation pull drying on me like I hear a lot. I use it when I want something more longwear or matte. Their new foundation sticks are amazing too! Much more hydrating and lighter coverage. The gloss bombs are incredible. I love the cream blushes too. Oh! And the new concealer is so good. I have minimal complaints. The match stix are on the dryer side, but again- that’s my longwear choice because it doesn’t slip and slide around. I just hit it with setting spray to moisten before blending. The products are really good imo and so is fenty skin."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I love the lip glosses and the cheeks out blushes. The complexion products can be a little orange on occasion but they do have a good shade range.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I like the cream blush, and am so happy they have a purple shade (Drama Class), but unfortunately it breaks me out mildly. But I love Drama Class so much as it's such a flattering shade for my olive skin tone, that I continue to wear it.

The Gloss Bomb lip gloss is incredible - really shiny and moisturising but not sticky - but the packaging leaks so badly it's enough make me consider if I should buy it again. I've lost about a third of the product from leakage.nSeriously, it needs an additional stopper in the tube to prevent this from happening. 

The cream Gloss Bomb wasn't as good. It just didn't seem to do as much as the original one, so I wouldn't buy any more from that range (and it also leaked)."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I like it !
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I’ve liked most of what I’ve tried so there’s a good amount of hype. I like the primers, the liquid eaze drops, and the heat lip gloss. 

I haven’t tried a lot of products but I think the range of shades they have makes products accessible. They don’t just have a lot of foundation colors but also concealers, bronzers, and powders."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I really love Eaze Drop Skin Tint. The shade is perfect and it applies so easily. I’d looked for a couple of months for a perfect shade match in a light coverage product.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"The hydra vizor moisturizer spf is my go to moisturizer and primer , any old foundation looks good on top of this moisturizer I can’t say enough good things about it , I’ll always repurchase"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I love the glosses and the liquid lipsticks . I also like their bronzer and contour . Foundation is not something I have tried I find the hydrating one is a bit too sits on my skin sort of
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I think it lives up to the hype for a lot of their products. The eyeshadows are great and pigmented, but for me Fenty’s lip products are the best. I love love the lip stains and liquid lipsticks, they’re to die for."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Their lip stuff & highlighters are great
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Love the lipstain - I have the purple one and would definitely buy more if they bought out some nude shades or a cool-toned red. 

The liquid Stunna lipstick is also amazing but you need to know the trick to getting it to stay put, which is using literally the bare minimum of product. I used it like a normal liquid lipstick for the first few tries and it got EVERY WHERE. My chin, my hands, my clothes, door handles, walls. I ended up googling if there was something I was missing about how to apply it and found a video they posted by Priscilla, Rihanna’s makeup artist which shows her wiping the applicator until there’s barely anything left on it and then applying to lips. Good makeup shouldn’t need to come with an instruction manual IMO but it’s a great product with that aside. 

I’ve tried the Matte liquid foundation and agree that it does oxidise but I have recently found out I was buying the wrong shade so I would give it another go in my actual shade. 

Love the lavender setting powder - you get a lot for your money and it goes a long way."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Their lipgloss is my favorite
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I like the contour stick in Amber, the glosses and the cream blushes. The eyeshadow is not good."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I like their glosses but that’s about it. They also have some nice liquid lipsticks.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Not a fan of the complexion products but they made ruffles within the beauty industry with the shade range when they popped out! So that’s amazing but I looooove their glosses probably my fav formula
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I love the bullet lipsticks, I just hate that they don't come with a case."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I love Rihanna, so I was initially drawn to the brand because of her. But evern years later now, I still use and love the lipgloss, concealer, liquid skin tint and contour stick regardless of who's behind the brand; they just work for me!"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,The cream blushes are HG status. I actually just repurchased petal poppin!
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Every time I use the blush/color stick I have I yell “CALL ME RIANNA” from the sailor j’s makeup tutorial…. 

I like it it’s the only product I have from that line."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I use one of their super pale concealers that ended up being too light for me (shocker bc I’m super pale) as an eyeshadow primer and it’s GREAT for making the colors pop and stay in place all day. I haven’t used any of the other products yet but that concealer is an excellent primer
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I only have the lip stain which i love btw, and yes i would repurchase
I’ve wanted to try the stick skin tint but i still have tom ford foundation sticks in few shades that i’ve been loving so i’m gonna wait. Also I’ve been reading mixed reviews about that"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I have been using one of her bronzers as eyeshadow and it has lasted me over four years :)
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"i love their foundation, the matte. zero transfer and lasts ALL day. u gotta work quick do as the dry down is fast. spreading/applying with fingers helps."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Over. I’ve tried a few different products and only found the powder highlighter works for me
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Appropriately hyped IMO. You need a very specific skin type for the foundation. I love the contour stick and the gloss a lot! A lot a lot.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I've only used the contour stick and highlighter, both beautiful"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,The only bronzer that works for my brown skin
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,My experience exactly.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,This. Had to switch/ wear only during the summer cause the shades were too orange.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I loved the shade range and found a great shade for me, but I found the oxidization issue triggered only after the self life was up - I've never had a foundation that changed in quality so sharply once the 6 months are up. 

It's why I stopped buying it, because I simply don't wear makeup daily so I can't use it up quick enough, despite how much I love their shade as a very cool toned pale person who always struggles with finding my shade."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"You tell me about the shade matching. I am very pale, with violet/blue undertones. I have spent so much on foundations that are 'not quite right', either too dark, too pink, too orange... I'm now using the pro filtr 110 (100 fit too but 110 fits better, which is crazy having not one but two shades that matched better than most have ever matched me), and it works great with my oily skin."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Ironically, they don’t have a good shade for me lol"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I will never use another gloss!
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"That lip stain is so pretty, but I never use it because it dries out my lips like mad! Did this ever happen to you?"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Which other brands have a similar formula? How can I find that out, for Fenty and in general? "
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I am not loyal to any brand but this highlighter is my absolute favorite! Fenty makes really good highlighters and its expensive but I think it's worth it. I know Ulta has 10x the points on black own brands this week and Fenty is included so it might be a good time to try it out!
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Why not?
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I love the mascaras. I always have a hard time finding foundations and colors to match my skin. I wear the brands lightest powder. It goes on really white but actually oxidizes perfectly for me.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,What does BDS stand for?
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Where’s in the list? I can’t find it.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Yeah it’s crazy cause they are meant for medium to deep skin tones. Or at least they market heavily to people in that skin tone range but they don’t do the job well. I mean I wear Estée Lauder in the shade 3n2 now and that seems to be my best match.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I have sensitive, combo skin and it works equally well on my oily and dry areas. Love the Pro Filtr so much."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I'm glad it works! I'm happy that since they started they've added a few more shades. Now they have my winter shade 410
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"I'm curious now, what's your skin like?"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Luminizer or Lip Cream?
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I blot it after letting it sit for 10 minutes and then top with aquaphor for some shine.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I love the color I have but it doesn't last long on me.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Let it dry, then chapstick!"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"the colours don't appeal to me. The lipstick formulas are not those that I like to use. As far as the more basic items are concerned, I can find incredible products at the drug store, so I save money. 

I also feel like people are intrigued because it is a brand with an entertainer as the face. I don't listen to her music, so that motivator isn't present for me."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Fenty is one of the brands supporting Israel so it’s on the BDS list to know which brands and companies to boycott
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,[https://boycott.thewitness.news/target/fenty](https://boycott.thewitness.news/target/fenty)
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Exactly! Thats what made me so excited to use them when they first came out but its wild cause even the concealers are too orange. I went to get shade matched this weekend and the girl helping me unprompted was like ""yeah, like I want to like them but they make everyone orange"" 
Got shade matched to NARS in Syracuse and it melts directly in and looks like my skin."
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Oof, darker shades have it worse. I have found that the foundation oxidizes a bit, but not so bad, does it oxidize a lot in darker shades?"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I have both and love them! The luminizer is my favorite
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,I'm asking about the makeup not the company's political stance.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"It does a little bit, but still ends up where I want it to. "
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Well you asked what BDS means not my problem if you don’t like the answer
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Everyone needs to politicize things. It's really sad.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,"Yeah, same then"
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,It’s not sad when you are affected by it. It’s the harsh reality.
Makeup,What's everyone's thoughts on Fenty Beauty? ,Exactly. Some people are worrying that they might die and we have the *privilege* of worrying about makeup.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Probably best to gift her a gift card and a makeup lesson.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Diamond bomb highlighter is my fav!
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,fenty gloss bomb might be a good pick
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I’ve heard their body butters, lip glosses and lip masks are very popular and would make great gifts. I personally love their eye brightener and powder foundation but those 2 would be tricky to gift"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Gloss bomb in Fu$$y
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"avoid the pro filtr foundation at all costs, it’s so dry and oxidizes so bad"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I love the heat lip gloss, the primers and the eaze drops. If you’re not sure what to give her, just get her a Sephora gift card because the sale is coming up."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I really love the powder foundation, but it’s probably not the best idea to gift someone unless the person receiving the gift does a proper colour match."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Yeah, I'd be safe and stick to a highlighter, blush, or lip gloss. She can always do a return or exchange too."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,diamond bomb 😫
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Gloss bomb or skin butta! You won’t really need to know her shade for either and they are two of the best Fenty products.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Gloss bomb or skin butta! You won’t really need to know her shade for either and they are two of the best Fenty products.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"i love their contour sticks but unless you’d know her shade, i’d play it safe with a highlighter or lip product"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Makeup artist here! The lipglosses, diamond bomb, and the powder bronzers."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I love the glosses, the cream bronzers and the cream blushes."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,The cheeks out bronzer is my favorite!! Gloss bomb is another good option
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I have the Hella Thicc mascara and it’s not my favorite, it’s fine! But this girl on tiktok had a mini series to see how long the fenty skin tint would last and it LASTS FOREVER, so I’d probably recommend that LOL"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Diamond bomb highlighter is definitely amazing gift! If she loves glitter,she will love this product too."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,The lip glosses are incredible I’ve gone through three in two years. Lots of wear and long lasting and I’d never buy another gloss.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,The skin tint
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,I like the Hella Thicc mascara. Also the moisturizer with spf.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Poutsicle lip stains are great!
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,I like her concealer.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Fenty just came out with a new highlighter that is so pretty!! The pearl one is my favorite but I’m fair light. The blush is also great especially the shade raisin standardz, it looks dark and purple but it’s literally beautiful on every skin tone and not dark purple. I don’t really like the diamond bomb highlighters they’re more for body glitter in my opinion"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"i love the lipglosses, the killawatt freestyle and diamond bomb highlighters and the bronzers! 💘"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Upvoting this. I am a makeup lover and I’d love to have a makeup card instead lol
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,I want to but my other sister hates the idea of gift cards and such. She thinks it’s not personal & meaningful enough 🫠
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,I agree
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I love the diamond bomb so much as an eyeshadow topper 🤩

^(edit: typo)"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Which color diamond bomb?
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,I got that as a gift and I really like it despite the fact that I mostly wear lipsticks.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,love this but it doesn’t last long :(
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,So does the Eaze Drop Skin Tint. I feel like all of the foundations oxidize pretty badly.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"I don't have this problem at all, but definitely avoid gifting foundation unless they have an established colour match and OP can find out what it is."
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Yes it is so dry and I have oily skin and it clings to some dry patches I did not know I have because non of the foundations does this to me…or it creates flakes. It even made my eyelids look flakey. I am so disappointed I spent money on this.

Even lose powder darkens when on face. (Same thing some Natasha Denona eyeshadows do to me). Weird"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Also their gloss bomb is amazing! I love RiRi, hot chocolate fantasy and fuchsia flex"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Also their body butter in cinnamon!! It’s limited edition from the holidays and on sale right now at Sephora for $32
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Well go with her to a makeup lesson then
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Then I’d get stuff where it’s hard to go wrong. Like perfume or hair care products. Makeup is personal and easy to get shades wrong.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Omg yes I do it too!! This and urban decay moondust are my fave toppers ✨
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,It is the shade how many carats! I think it fits any skin tone actually as it does not really have a base color and is almost purely silver sparkles.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Aw sorry to hear that. 😕 Mine do.
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,Mine lasts so long!
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,"Both of these I struggled so much with. They oxidise like crazy and CLING to texture. The Eaze Blur Stick is good, though. It’s my current daily wear"
Makeup,What’s the best of Fenty Beauty? ,maybe it’s just me then🥲the dior lip maximiser lasts super long on me but it’s pricey
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"Fenty lip glosses are my absolute favorite, that’s the number one thing I buy from Fenty. Those gloss bomb stix are to die for. I also really like the match stick contour, that’s the only contour I use. Not sure about the other products, I haven’t tried them. I’m here for the lip glosses."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I would recommend ELF as a brand to experiment with if you’re just starting out, they’re great and inexpensive. Glossier is less inexpensive but great on sensitive skin and ingredient list wise, and so is Kosas. Fenty makes great lip glosses, can’t go wrong with those, not sure whether most of the rest of what they make is worth the money"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"The only thing I buy from Fenty is their Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint. I’ve gotten great use out of it, they have my exact shade and it doesn’t break me out. Also it lasts forever, I’ve loved it so far. Other than this most things can be found for a more affordable price and similar or better quality."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"They're good. I have their cream blush, powder, Brow MVP. 

I think it's easier to ask a staff member from a makeup store to show you how to use it. In person it's a lot easier than it looks online. They are easy to use."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I would start with drugstore, until you have a better idea of shades/products that you like, like for example liquid eyeliner vs pencil vs gel, cream blush vs powders, pink vs berry, etc etc"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I’m going to disagree with some of the others and recommend going into a makeup store or to a makeup counter to get shade matched. You could make many wrong guesses with drugstore making before finding something that works for you. If you’re near a Sephora, you can get shade matched to any foundation, including Fenty, and they’ll also give you samples of 3 shades. That will allow you to practice applying it home once or twice to see if you like it. You can also see how it wears / holds up on your skin over the course of the day. If you like it, you can purchase it. If you don’t, you can get shade matched and get samples of something else. 

For Fenty specifically, I’ve only tried a few things. They don’t have a good shade match for me in any of the foundations, so I can’t speak to those. I love the Invisimatte pressed powder for touching up my oily skin during the day, though. I’ll typically get some oiliness coming through by early afternoon, so I blot and then pay on a little bit of the Invisimatte. It works great. I also like the eyeshadow stick, although I can’t remember what it’s called. Lastly, the Poutsickle lip stain is an excellent lip stain! None of those colors work for me either sadly, and there aren’t a ton of colors. I would be ecstatic if they expanded the range. But, the swatches on my hand have been harder to get off than anything else I’ve ever tried. I bought one in hopes that it would work for me, and they’re really pigmented with great staying power. The shade just didn’t work, though :("
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I love their cream products
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Overrated and expensive for no reason
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I like their blush (easy to use/apply and didn’t cause me any skin issues). I also like their lip gloss. 
Their foundation doesn’t seem to be a lot for the amount they’re selling it for so I haven’t bothered."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I am using their gloss, compact pro filtr powder (works nice on oilier skin, buildable coverage), and their setting powder (for me it works way better than Laura Mercier one). I don't use too much of foundation products, so can't comment."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I have super sensitive skin and have never had issues with their products. They are not super scented either.
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I don't think many of Fenty's are as beginner friendly as Lawless or even something like Colour pop might be. Stay away from matte liquid lips for sure. The only foundation I would consider from them for a beginner is the ease drops.
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I have very sensitive dry skin. Im also super pale.
So I love that brand, I dont like their matte foundation, but thats my skin, not the foundation. I use several of their lip products, blushes and highlighter and love them all. I use the summer edition powder blush daily. 

I personally find them easy to use. Except the cream blushes, you need to have used cream blushes before."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I love Fenty makeup, I have very sensitive skin I have roseaca and their makeup doesn't bother me but they do have fragrance not a foul ugly one but a soft sweet one. I love the loose powder it was recently on sale at Ulta."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I've never  liked anything from them except the diamond bombs and match stix, everything else feels a bit underwhelming"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I highly recommend the tutorials. Start with proper skin care, it’s the base for everything else that goes on your face. There are videos just for beginners.

As far brands, I doubt many women wear one line only. Almost every piece of my makeup comes from different  company. The idea is to find what works for you. 
Visit Sephora and Ulta to see what’s out there. New things are released continuously but learn the basics first.
Have fun and welcome to my addiction!💗"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Their foundation was very drying and their skin tint was super gross. Very greasy and looked awful
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"Love Rihanna and Fenty as a whole for what they do for the cosmetics world and a lot of the lip products are bomb but a lot of their complexion products and skincare can break a lot of people out / aren’t great for sensitive skin.

If you want to support the brand I would get some lip products from fenty and maybe blushes/bronzer but stay away from the foundations and skincare, just my experience and anecdotal evidence from people I know

Most importantly, whatever you choose have fun with it! :)"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I love their slip shine line and bullet lipsticks and highly recommend, but am not a fan of the glosses. They make my lips cracked and chapped somehow."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I love their brown liquid eyeliner! I’ve tried others but always go back to fenty!
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I love their matte liquid lipsticks, setting powder and lip glosses.

I’ve tried their foundation which is good but I’m not the best judge as I don’t use it regularly. If you have the funds try what you’re interested in and have fun"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"the diamond highlighter, i use it for the eyes and it's an easy look to do if you like the wet/glittery look and it lasts forever."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Surprised no one has mentioned fenty’s concealer I’ve been using it for a couple of years after reading reviews and I really like the coverage
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,i have 2 eyeshadow pallets and are super pigmented
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"I love Fenty Beauty but I’m done with the hype hehe so expensive when Maybelline sells the exact formula in an affordable price.

I love Fenty’s lipglosses (I’m a lipgloss lady) my lips don’t feel sticky and it leaves them so hydrated.

I have combination skin and sometimes it gets sensitive during cold and hot weather and Fenty’s base is lighter but it gives you full coverage."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Fent THIS
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"They claim to be cruelty free but their parent comp is not, so keep that in mind if ethicality is one of your concerns."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Seconded. This is a great product
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I agree
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"Same. I love the Fenty ease drop stick and looks so flawless, cream blush in drama class and the hella thick mascara is incredible. I also love the gloss bombs and still want to try the lip liner and gloss Bomb sticks."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"As an added note, I suggest shopping the the high priced dupes. Don’t invest in expensive makeup until you’ve learned how use makeup. ❣️"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"+1 for Fenty's Gloss Balm Stix. Hydrating, not sticky, color can be sheer or built up."
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,I didn't know this. Who is the parent company?
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Yup. There’s so many makeup brands these days but Fenty’s one of the ones I’m always looking out for new releases
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"LVMH - they house multiple cosmetic brands including Benefit, which is not cruelty free as far as I know"
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,but does fenty itself test on animals? google says they don’t
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,Itself doesnt but since its parent company does then its its impssible to tell wether your money will toward animal testing or not. So if its one of your concerns then i will say just steer clear from this brand completely.
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,they do not! I rely on crueltyfreekitty to verify
Makeup,opinions on fenty beauty ,"interesting, don’t know if i agree with that"
Makeup,"if i’m shade 220 for fenty beauty foundation,what shade of tirtir cushion foundation i should get?","when you input your match into [findation.com](http://findation.com), it gives the answer ""24w soft beige"". so, if you choose a shade lighter, you'd go with 21w if you want the correct undertone, since there's no 23w or 22w on the list. you could also go with 23n if you want it to oxidise to the right depth. i'm only guessing, though, since i don't actually know how the shades oxidise."

Makeup,Charlotte Tilbury vs Fenty Beauty Bronzer,I only have the CT in cream and i love it. It’s a cream to powder formula that works on my oily combo skin.
Makeup,How to use fenty beauty pro filt’r foundation???,One of the best ways to get a flawless base is skin prep. Your skin needs to be hydrated enough. I’ve never tried the Fenty foundation but whenever my foundation clings to dry spots it means my skin isn’t hydrated enough
Makeup,How to use fenty beauty pro filt’r foundation???,"Good skin prep is the first step. I layer on toner, lotion, moisturiser and a sunscreen before any foundation and it makes everything sit better. All of my products are hydrating and moisturising since I have chronically dry skin with eczema every so often. 

I typically use a light layer and a damp sponge. I use a palette knife to “cut” the foundation (like Korean MUAs do), put it on where I need the most coverage (usually the centre of my cheeks and the top of my nose, between my brows) and blend using the damp sponge. It’s a very finicky foundation and probably only really works on those with fully oily skin (like I’ve heard Rihanna has) but with good skin prep and lighter application, you can make it work."

Makeup,How to use fenty beauty pro filt’r foundation???,normally I use brushes to apply my foundation but with this one I needed to use a sponge. I hate dealing with sponges and beauty blenders but this foundation really needs the damn sponge. I have oily skin and it clung to patches for me at first too. I also was using too much. try less and use a damp sponge and see if that helps.
Makeup,How to use fenty beauty pro filt’r foundation???,"I'm having this exact problem with this foundation, but not with others I've tried. I'm currently on the look for a real long lasting transfer free foundation and this is not it for me. The color is great, it goes on great but gets cakes after 3 hours no matter my prep. I'm going to return it tomorrow. 
I just ordered an Estee Lauder (maybe spelled that wrong) foundation to try next. 
I like Maybelline 30 hour for normal days but that transfers easy if you touch your face. (But does not get cakey for me)"

Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I highly suggest their lip products, their Gloss Bombs are AMAZING!"
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I LOVE Fenty Beauty liquid lipsticks. I have smoked bongs, blunts, and bowls then had a cup of coffee and the lip didn't BUDGE.

I also love the matchstix, they're versatile and long-wearing. I find the highlighters to be a bit pigmented for me so unless you have the EXACT blush/bronzer match, I'd stick to the white/diamond highlighter."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,[deleted]
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I love their foundation, mascara, the match stix I use one for blush called yacht lyfe. I also use their highlighter mean money hustla baby, but I don’t use highlighter at all anymore but it was good."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,Lipsticks. I love their lipsticks! Any foundation products of theirs I tried (original matte foundation and the powder foundation) I didn't like at all.
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"Coming from someone who only has Fenty products in her makeup kit: 

Expensive but one of a kind products: 
•Diamond bomb (every time I wear it I always get compliments about it) 
•Killawatt highlighters (personal fav is mimosa sunrise/sangria sunset. The colours are bright but they wear so well. 10/10)

Must have basics:
•match stix (I use the tan 300s trio along with a few highlighter shades and they’re just amazing on my skin and help me get that youthful glow) 
•mattemoiselles -super light on your lips and the colours are so beautiful! Griselda is my fav and I’ve gone through 3 of them. They have whatever colour you can think of and they always look amazing. 

I can list like 10 other items that you should get but I could do so much with just these products. They’re so nice and I hope this helps!"
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I really liked her origional primer. I havent tried the others. My main complaint was I didn't like the scent of the product but once I had my makeup on it went away. I found it was nice for my makeups base, I just had to remind myself to go light on the primer. I have oily-dehydrated skin.

I have the highlighter in Trophy Wife. I LOVE THIS SO MUCH but its gold-gold, like the laughter of a leprechaun running through long grass 🤭. I'm half indigenous(canadian) and really pale yellow-ish tones so it's a little extra but it looks fabulous. Very bling but I use it as highlighter, eyeshadow (wet/dry), and dab it on top of lip products.

I also have the cream blush in fuego. The product is nice but it has a sparkly look to it. I would call it less of a ""cream blush"" and more of a cheek gloss. It's a perfect light look for what I was going for."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"My favourites are the gloss bombs, and the cream blushes and bronzer."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,Visit Sephora and check out their foundation/concealer. I like the matchstick trios and the brightening under eye concealer
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,Gloss and cream blush to start!
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I really like the powder foundation and the loose powder, both are excellent quality. I dont recommend the gloss bombs as IME they dont perform any better than much cheaper options, and the sickly sweet fragrance is not for everyone."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"Hi! So I have a lot from Fenty as I used to work at sephora. The Concealers are really nice but dry super fast. I love her highlighters, but I have some from too Faced that are more subtle, that's just my person preference. If you don't already, I highly recommend her primers. I bought my first one like 6 months ago and im never going back. I prefer soft matte since I get a little oily in tzone but am dry in winter. But overall, get whatever you want! Fenty has amazing products overall and I doubt you can go wrong!!"
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,I just got the primer in a boxycharm and I love it.
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,The cream blushes and bronzers are really nice.
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I’d definitely go for the Cheeks Out Cream Blush and Bronzer (Cool Berry and Rose Latte are my favorites of the blushes), and the Eaze Drops Skin Tint. I wouldn’t spend it on the Gloss Bombs because while they’re nice, the Maybelline Lifter Glosses are just as nice if not nicer. Topaz is a perfect dupe for the original Fenty Glow Gloss Bomb, and Stone is a good dupe for the Fenty Glow Cream Gloss Bomb. I actually prefer the Maybelline and reach for it over Fenty every time."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,I love their Diamond bomb shade How Many Carats?!
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I love gloss bomb! It does need reapplied, but it feels nice and smooth, and not sticky. The bronzer was disappointing imo though."
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,The contour stick
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,The What It Dew mist is really nice. I spray about 3 pumps on a cotton round and use it as a toner.
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"The highlighter if you're extra! They're also very versatile as an eyeshadow topper, brow bone highlight, along the collarbone etc. The match sticks are easy and quick, although I feel like they could have more coverage but if you don't need it then go for it. My favorite gem is the red eyeliner!! Looks so good on really any eye color"
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,The concealer is my absolute favorite. It matches my skin so perfectly
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,If you’re a perfume person maybe try that? I heard it smells really good :)
Makeup,What should I buy from Fenty Beauty?,"I love their lip glosses, but idk if I’d pay full price for them. The highlighters are also nice. If you like super pigmented eyeshadow, the blue eye/face palette shaped like an octagon (I think? I can’t remember the name of it) has some really pigmented shades, but be warned the glittery ones are literally nothing but glitter. I couldn’t use any of those as highlighters because they were so glittery. 

Now if you travel…I got two of the little mini eyeshadow palettes that snap together, and now I have a double-sided palette that’s so tiny, I love it. And the shades are nice and buttery. Not super pigmented, but great for everyday wear."

Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I am shocked at the fact that your gloss bomb even lasted so long! I usually use lipsticks and glosses wayyyyyy past the date they are supposed to be tossed, provided they don't look or smell off. But my gloss bomb in Fussy turned bad within 5-6 months from the date I bought it, its color changed to a muddy brown and the texture changed too, so I had to toss it not even halfway used. The fact that yours still sounds useable after 3 years is amazing!"
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,I have some sort of health anxiety so if something has been opened for too long I save myself the scare and toss it but for anyone who doesn’t I’d say go for it . It would save me a lot of money 😂
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I have many lipsticks, to the point I need to give some away. I've had 3 expire on me in 4 years: 2 Kaja (same formula, the creme) which only made it 6 months before it smelled like petrol, and Etude House's Sweet Potato Red -- it looked like it had white mold on the inside. That one lasted about 2 years.

If it looks okay, smells okay, and performs as originally intended, I don't worry about it."

Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"Tbh I don’t throw stuff out unless it’s gone bad and you can tell by smell.  I just dont go through everything as fast as I love to buy pretty new things (working on this fatal flaw). Except mascara, which I do throw out around the suggested amount of time.  No way to sanitize inside that and it touches my eye.  I figure digestive enzymes will kill most stuff I’m putting on my lips.  Probably."
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I usually keep my lip gloss for about 2 years, but I use them often."
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,I still have and use mine too - got about 20% left. I’ll keep using it till it smells bad or the formula breaks down. One thing I do now is buy minis. They might cost more on a ml for ml basis but the outlay is less and it takes me a long time to use things up as I like to have a few things in my collection. I’d rather pay $15 for 15ml and use it up than $20 for 30ml and only use half of it - if you are finding makeup lasts a long time maybe you could do the same for future purchase.
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Part of me wants to say yes but I still have my 2019 one 😬 I only throw out till I pan or it’s off
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I’ve used one bottle of NYX butter gloss for 2 years, but now that I’ve gotten more into lip glosses they only last me about 4 months because I wear lipstick everyday 

I still wear foundation, highlighter and other matte lipstick from 3-4 years ago lol… I’ve never had any problems. But I don’t do a full face of makeup often. I only throw things away if they dry out or if it goes bad"
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I threw mine out when it started burning to put it on 🙃

Just bought a new one."
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,I’ve got the original release of the UD naked heat palette from like… 18/19? Still going strong and works great. I’d say unless it’s causing some kind of reaction or smells strange that you’re good
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Lip stuff is usually fine for years and years!! The only make up stuff I tend to throw away is concealer or foundation :)
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Use a cotton pad with alcohol to clean out the container as it’s probably rife with bacteria. Use another to gently take off top layer of gloss. Fresh and bacteria free!
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"I have a product I love that was discontinued in 2009(!), Laura Mercier's Mulberry lip stain in a pot. It's the perfect reddish brown I've held onto in the hopes that I can go get it custom made from one of those bespoke lipstick brands. But anyways, I don't use it anymore because I'm a germaphobe and I really wish I could. I wouldn't use anything on the lips older than like 2 years."
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"Foundation, primer, blush and eyeshadow may last up to 2 years. Lipstick should last for one year after it is opened. Eye makeup such as mascara and eyeliner would need to be replaced every three months.

Now if you didn’t use it much your probably fine but this brings up an even bigger issue of why are we paying so much for name brands when majority of our products are coming from the same conglomerates. 

It’s much easier to toss a $10 product versus $100 product. JS Just did a tutorial of a Gucci blush and he said you pay $50 for the same formula of a drugstore brand that charges you $8. So they got $40 extra for a package."

Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Is the shiny part of the top peeling off of yours? I was sad when I discovered mine doing that. Actually I’m still sad about it.

Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"Also depends how you’ve stored your makeup. If you’ve kept your gloss and lipsticks out of direct sunlight, and always sealed it well, then I’ve read that it’s safe to keep for over two years. 
But agree with what a lot of people are saying here, that if you’ve noticed the consistency has changed, it’s separating or has a weird smell, toss it out regardless of how long you’ve had it. 
Lip gloss also seems less durable than lipstick to me. No evidence behind that other than just a feel for how glosses seem to have a lot of moisture that can go bad sooner."
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"Lipsticks I'm less worried about because they're solid, and you can always remove the top layer. I'm pretty strict about throwing out old lip gloss though. 
Unless you completely remove your lip product before eating, you end up not just putting it on your face, but ultimately consuming a little bit of it. Plus, if you're reapplying after meals, are you getting tiny trace amounts of grease or saliva on the wand and then putting it back in the gloss? I know there's ingredients in the gloss to stop bacterial growth, but those eventually break down and stop working as well. Maybe I'm a little bit of a germaphobe, but after about a year I toss them!"
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,If it looks smells and feels fine it’s fine. Just patch test it on to ur inner arm if you are worried and see if you get a reaction
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Do a patch test on your skin
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,"No, same! I mean, for what they cost……not gonna throw it out if it looks fine, smells fine and texture is the same as before…."

Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,Noooooo…. It’s especially prone to bacteria growth.
Makeup,should i toss out my fenty beauty gloss bomb from 2019?,There is a little code on the bottom for expiry. If it’s got a 24 - good for 24 months. 12 - good for a year. Etc etc. I absolutely throw things said to be expired! Ew.

Makeup,"Looking for affordable dupes/recommendations: Dior Skim Correct Concealer, Fenty Beauty Skin tint, Benefit roller liner",How do they get away with charging $30—or $40!—-for concealer? That’s a crime.
Makeup,"Looking for affordable dupes/recommendations: Dior Skim Correct Concealer, Fenty Beauty Skin tint, Benefit roller liner",Ahh that concealer is so good. I'm sadly to say I couldn't find a better dupe. I always go back to it
Makeup,"Looking for affordable dupes/recommendations: Dior Skim Correct Concealer, Fenty Beauty Skin tint, Benefit roller liner",I love the new tower 28 concealer. It is so good!

Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,I got that set too and it was GORGEOUS. I love the gloss and the blush. Unfortunately riri is doing us dirty by not making any staples that are at least similar.
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,I haven’t tried the Fenty one but from the pictures it gives me Dear Dahlia Blooming Edition Paradise Dual Palette/Blusher Duo - Candy Castle vibes. It has the same orange/peach tone. Hope you find the perfect dupe 🤗
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,"I’ve not tried the peach shade, but have a cream blush in rose latte and quite like it. The Fuego flush shade is a similar orangy shade. 

Elf make a good dupe for the orange orange cream blush in the luminous putty blushes which I bought. It’s not exact but it’s a nice cream formula"
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,I’ve been on the hunt for so long to find a dupe and I finally landed on Refy’s peach blush. I might actually love it even more than the fenty one.
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,"Yes, I love both the blush and the gloss"

During Black Friday I had saw the gloss on the site and stocked up but not the blush."
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,I have the rose latte as well (not similar to the resting peach face) isn’t it limited edition as well? Fueling flush shade is lighter and more shimmery but I was thinking maybe if I mixed it. I’ll look into elf
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,Omg this is going to sound terrible but I’m glad we had the same struggles lol
Makeup,Has anyone tried fenty beauty resting peach face duo,I’m going to go to Sephora to test it out

Makeup,Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation,"I'm currently trying to work my way through a bottle of this foundation. It's okay, but there are some drawbacks to the formula and colors and I would not purchase it again.

First, it's very matte, but also doesn't last on my skin all day. I feel like it fails spectacularly around my oily nose. The warm tones are a tinge too yellow IMO.

I don't know. Even with setting sprays and different primers, my skin just sort of looks worse with this foundation. Maybe it's just for people with dewy smooth skin who like this level of coverage 🤷‍♀️"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation,The color matches me so perfectly and it's great for oily skin. Now I do suggest good prep and not use it on dry flaky areas or areas prone to dehydration. It lasts well and wears well for me. Catrice hd liquid is the same ingredients and scent and they are both made in the same country so I highly suspect it's the same thing but fenty has a way better shade range.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation,Oh very good to know! I want to try Catrice. Where do they sell it ?
Makeup,Fenty Beauty by Rihanna Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Longwear Liquid Foundation,">I like my current foundation, but I guess I'm always on the lookout for something even better lol.

I think this mindset is how I ended up with the Fenty foundation TBH! 😂

I've used higher-end and drugstore foundations, and honestly, I always tend to go back to L'Oreal. I'm currently using their True Match foundation, but I've used their Infallible line before and really liked it (but not the super matte one that comes in a tube).

As of more recently on the higher-end, I've tried NARS Radiant Longwear and did not like it. Didn't last at all and their color formulations tend to lean a little too cool. I've also tried their concealer which I feel somehow had less coverage than that foundation, and Orgasm blush was way too sparkly. I've sworn myself off that brand, lol.

On the lower end, Elf is not great. I feel like people like it because of the price point, but there's something noticeably off about all of their foundation/concealer color formulations, and their lip/eye products lack pigment.

I don't think higher-end is bad or anything, but for my day-to-day wear, there's not enough of a difference for me to pay the extra cost. I'm pretty happy with the quality of foundation and concealer from both L'Oreal and Milani. Hope this helps!"
Makeup,Best primer for Fenty Beauty skin tint?,fenty beauty is silicone based so it should work
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"Yeah, and I quite like them for a natural look! I got fuego flush and petal poppin. Only thing I’ll say is don’t overblend them, because whatever foundation you have on underneath will be lifted."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I LOVE IT. I have Cool Berry (color exactly as it sounds) and wear it on my cheeks and a little on my eyelids some days. There are a lot of YouTube videos with swatches to see the colors. I am planning on ordering a few more.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"My skintone is light-medium with warm/yellow undertones. I bought Petal Poppin and enjoy it for light makeup days. It gives me a pretty flush and I find it easy to blend with my fingers. That being said, I'm not sure I'll pick up any other colors. Fuego Flush and Rose Latte are the only others ones that tempt me but I have a blush that looks similar to Rose Latte and I'm not sure how much use I'd get out of Fuego Flush."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I bought petal poppin, and I'm light warm/neutral. I thought it was too barbie pink, and it didn't look natural on me. Maybe I'm not doing it right but it either barely showed up or was too much :("
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I bought petal poppin and rose latte. I get more use out of the latter because it doubles as a gorgeous lip color where as the former is too light to use anywhere but the cheeks.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I have a fair skin tone and bought fuego flush. LOVE the formula, but the color doesn’t look so great on me. However, it might be because I have a cooler undertone. If you are more neutral or warm, it might work better for you"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,Definitely get it! I use it for a natural look!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I’m extremely pale and I decided to try Cool Berry—my cheeks get really red naturally so I try to stay away from really bright pink and that’s a nice mauve-y color. Anyways I think the formula and color is great!! I would definitely buy another.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I haven't tried them, but they look gorgeous. I've watched a lot of YouTubers swatch them. I'm interested in Bikini Martini - cool purply pinks usually look really pretty on my neutral fair skin tone, especially as a pop of color on top of something more neutral.

Another great, smaller Black-owned makeup brand is Danessa Myricks. She has tons of gorgeous multi purpose colors - every color you could imagine. They're quite pigmented and lend well to being mixed with creams and balms to make them even more emollient."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I have Drama Cla$$.  I really like it. It isn't nearly as scary as it looks at all. In this picture, I just have a skin tint and the blush on.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hXaMBwFF_qHxsCZ63gTSESfoYvCZlHs/view?usp=drivesdk"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I have Summertime Wine, Daiquiri Dip, and Drama Class. I'm very fair neutral/warm and they're all good colors on me. I have to be very careful and use a tiny amount of product, but it sheers out just fine on me. I find it's easier to control with a brush than fingers, but I can make either work ok. It's definitely harder to blend out than cloud paint, but I think it's worth it for the colors. I haven't tried it on top of foundation yet - I use it for light makeup days where I only have on some skin tint and concealer.

Daiquiri dip is my favorite and I use it on my eyes too for a monochrome look. The blush definitely becomes the focal point of the look when I use any of them."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I got fuego flush and enjoy it but I’m not happy with the amount of product you get, 3 grams or .10 ounces.  It has micro glitter in the formula. I’ve actually been using more my Flower Beauty Blush Bomb in Nectar(cream blush in a tube) which is close in shade to fuego flush. I paid a fraction of the price for it and it has .3 fluid ounces or 9 milliliters. https://imgur.com/a/xu4kc9v"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I’m a big fan of Benefit’s Dandelion blush. I have fair/light skin and am always worried about looking too flushed or having too much blush on. This one is just the right shade and definitely buildable if you like your blush to stand out more.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I haven't tried the FB cream blushes but another cream blush I really like is Glossier Cloudpaint. It $16 per tube and imo you get more product. There are less colors but they have two lighter shades (one that's more beige and one that's a light peach) and I love them since it looks like a natural flush and they're not as scary for a cream blush newbie as the bright red fenty shades
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I got Fuego Flush. The formula of the product is not so much a cream blush but almost like a cheek gloss?? It's nice, easy to build. Quite sparkly though. Downside is that the product is tiny. Theres only 3g of product and isn't much larger than some single eyeshadow pans (some are bigger than)"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I love the blush but it’s mostly for the shades available. I have medium-tan skin and got drama class. It’s unlike any other cream blush I own. I’m obsessed with it and want to get rose latte and cool berry.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I have light skin with nuetral/ warm undertones! I got the shade Petal poppin and while the color is pretty and looks very natural on me the formula isn't my favorite.  It's good but not  great. I actually prefer the Milk Make up blush/ lip sticks for my cream blush!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I will definitely give those a try
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I got crush on cupid and really like it! I'm rather fair and cool toned, so bright pinks actually look really natural on me when blended out, and it was sheerer than I thought it would be(not a bad thing, you tend to need to be a light hand with creams) it's small, but a little goes a long way and I think I'll actually hit pan with this before I get bored and buy something else."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I have not tried them but I love the Glossier blushes. They blend super easily and are nice for when you're not using powder.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I bought fuego flush and daiquiri drip, I’m super fair and I love them both!! 10/10 would recommend."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I’m pretty pale and my favorite product to use for blush is the Fenty match stick in Yacht Life. I use a thick fluffy synthetic brush (I think it’s a real technique face brush) and swipe it across the stick and then sort of dab it on like you would a beauty blender. Pretty sort of peachy color with a little shimmer to it. My simple go to work look is just that, mascara, and brow gel."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,I love it! I have medium dark skin and it shows up well. For fair skin I recommend drama cla$$! I know purple sounds intimidating but think about it!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I have fair cool skin with lots of redness and I got rosé latte (which felt risky since it is the deepest shade), but I use it sparingly with a fluffier brush and I LOVE it. It gives a beautiful, natural, nude flush."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I have very fair, neutral skin. I own petal poppin, rose latte, and fuego flush. Personally, I’m not a fan of petal poppin. It gave me major Barbie vibes, in the worst way. Don’t be afraid of the darker shades, because these are so buildable a lot of the deeper shades are beautiful options as well. Rose latte happens to be my favorite shade."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"Put powder over your foundation, mist your powder, then add the cream blush. Works SOOOO well with Fenty's and won't lift your foundation"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,which shade do you use? I have light to fair skin wit pink undertones
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,It looks so natural!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,Daiquiri dip is my FAVE! I was sunburnt earlier this week and it matched burn perfectly - love that look 🥰
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,this works for me too. it makes a world of a difference
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"I’m the same, fair and pink cool undertones. I love petal poppin and strawberry drip. Petal poppin is more nudey pink and strawberry drip is more red and bright but still so sheer so it looks natural on my skin still. Strawberry drip is my fav"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,"Lol, me too. There's something about that slightly burned look that just goes well with my skin tone. Daiquiri Dip and Nars Exhibit A both straddle the line between sunburned and natural flush for me. Was I outside? Just finished a run? Had some fun with the BF? Nobody knows, but it's cute!

If you've ever seen one of Kackie's videos on youtube, she's a master at the blush everywhere aesthetic."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,no problem! I honestly didn’t use blush before it was recommended to me by an employee at Sephora and it changed my life
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Cream Blush,Strawberry Drip is so underrated
Makeup,"I'm saving up my money, should I buy the Fenty lip stain in mai type (I've been wanting FOREVER) or the Fenty beauty heat lip gloss in Ethier the brown or red one? (it's so pretty I've also wanted it for a while) I can't decide there both so pretty but I wanna know which one is worth it!",I love Mai type 💋

Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Your best bet is to use as a mix in with a foundation with more hydrating ingredients. I haven't tried it but I'm glad that I didn't because it seems too drying.
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Broke me out to high hell. I'd start the day with a clear face and by hour two would have multiple small zits all across my cheeks and forehead. It was my first high end foundation and I was no impressed whatsoever
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"It’s my favourite to be honest, but I have extremely oily skin. I use a beauty blender and build it in layers. Focus on small sections of the face, blend it out, move to another area and layer over dry areas to build coverage. It lasts all day on me through an eight hour hosting shift. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"What sort of primer/skin care are you combining it with?

I've seen some who mix liquid foundations that don't work with their skin type with a face cream that works. Or using a really good, hydrating primer to make sure the skin is as good as it gets before applying foundation.

Fenty is supposed to be buildable, so if you don't get good coverage you could try that. I have a lot of redness due to scarring, and have found that colour correcting primers can really help, but again you have to find one that works with your skin type and the product you apply over it. I used Smashbox photo finish colour correcting, and it came out great in photos, but I didn't like the feel of it too much, because my oily skin repelled it and it sort of crumbled."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I found that it dries way too quickly to use with a Beauty Blender.

Your best bet is using a brush to buff it in and to work in small sections.

It was meh for me, I didn’t love or nor did I hate it.
I don’t think I’d repurchase it."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,It’s not just you. I don’t like the color pay off of this foundation at all. Even with all the shade range I couldn’t find one that looked right on me. 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,I hated this foundation. I had to return it to Sephora. It was so dry and I looked horrible in my shade because it oxidizes and turns so many shades darker! I looked like an oompa loompa lol. I went with it cosmetics CC cream and I love it 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Same. And it oxidized so bad. The color I got matched with is too dark. Ugh
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I have pretty dry skin and use this foundation sometimes (I think in the same shade as you!). Obviously, I have to start with moisturizer. Then I mix it with the Smashbox Primerizer on the back of my hand and apply with a sponge. I use a pump of the primerizer and a pump of the foundation (a 1:1 ratio). That’s the only way I have gotten it to work, and it’s still pretty dry. I only still use it because I’m hate-panning it."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I haven't used it, but I have heard it's best suited for people with oily skin but little texture (so oily, but no acne). If you want to use it but have dry or normal skin you probably want to prime with something moisturizing, or mix with a hydrating foundation. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"It definitely can be a little drying for me too. I can wear it in the summer, no problem but in the winter, i have to be more careful. I really like it with Smashbox’s radiant primer. I don’t really set it either. And then I use a hydrating setting spray. Hope this helps. If not remember, not everything is for everyone.  If you wanna support Rihanna or the brand try some of the other products "

Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Hey hun. This foundation seems to be more for people with normal to oily skin. Seems like you need a more hydrating foundation formulated for combo skin since you have dry and oily. I have eczema and dry skin and I was told to stay away from it
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I got a trial size for it and I hate it. I have normal skin, and I try to look dewy and hydrated with foundations so I mainly use tinted moisturizers (I'm not a full coverage person). I tried this and it made my skin look so dry, and it oxidized pretty badly too. I'm very happy I didn't get on the ""hype"" and buy a full size. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,I tried it and returned it within a week. I have oily skin so I assumed it would be my new HG. I’m pretty sure it also broke me out because my acne has become significantly worse in the last few days (I returned it yesterday) than it had been prior to that. I’m disappointed it didn’t work but I definitely tried it a few ways; just wasn’t for me I guess. 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I mix it with the old ysl touche eclat foundation and it’s wonderful. 1 pump of each. However, I tried it with the new too faced tutti Frutti foundation and they were shit together."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Looks horrible on me unless I mix it with facial oil
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Try it mixed with L’Oréal pro glow!! I’ve never received more compliments on my complexion! 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I don't like it either. I wanted to love it, because the color match was PERFECT, but it's just not great for dry skin -- it sticks to dry patches really badly. Plus if you try to build up the coverage, the second layer will just wipe off the first layer, making it look really patchy. :-( I used it a few times, then sold it."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Honestly I’m so sad to hear this. I use a DRY blender when I do it and i wear it every day. Granted I have dry combination skin and it’s only suitable for certain skin types. Since it oxidizes so quick I just put a tiny bit on the blender and work that into my skin one area at a time. Once it’s dried it has like flawless texture and appearance in my opinion. It’s not meant to be full coverage. It’s fairly moderate to full.. but I have to issue with it covering everything I want covered. I also set it immediately after I finish my face to prevent ANY and ALL creasing and smearing. Whatever you do don’t use a brush to apply, WAY TOO STREAKY lol. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,I don’t like it. It’s the smell. It’s so annoying. I think it looks nice but I can’t put pass the smell. Same with the Huda. I wish they’d stop fragrancing foundation. 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I wanted to love it, I tried 2 different shades but neither looked quite right. Plus my skin is normal to dry and it just made my skin look so dry. I tried mixing it with moisturizer but it just looked terrible on my skin. But I did love the primer, I actually just finished the bottle I bought."
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"It was my first high end foundation too, I feel you. The same thing happened to me plus it dries too quick on my combination skin "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,That's strange! It sounds like maybe you had an allergic reaction to the foundation? That has happened to me with certain lotions. 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I use Smashbox's silicone based primer, and I use a moisturizer before I put anything on. I think that using something creamier could help, but the foundation literally dries up within seconds! "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Yep. I think the shade is too yellow for my skin, but the lightest shade would be way too pale, and a shade darker would be obviously too dark!!"
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Yeah, it's just not working out for me. I bought it last-minute because my go-to Makeup Forever foundation was discontinued :/"
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,I agree that it can be too streaky! 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,Or a moisturizer and make a tinted moisturizer or even with a primer.
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I have super sensitive skin, so unfortunately it’s not a new reaction for me. Just sucked because I wanted to love it so much "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,[deleted]
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Yeah, seconding the advice to try a different primer. Silicone primer does not play well with Fenty, sadly. (Of course YMMV, and it’s probably ok if it’s not quite the right foundation for you!)"
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,I used to have the smash box primer it made all my foundations look bad including my Fenty one. So I changed it for a different one and the Fenty one is my HG foundation now. If you have dryer skin and pores I suggest benefit porefessional actually. I used to not like it then I tried again and it really works well with this foundation. Nyx angel veil is a really good dupe for it as well.  And for more hydration on dryer places I like the niod photography fluid! Works really well with this foundation. 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"flat foundation brush, just make sure not to use too much at once or it'll be streaky. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"See, I love it because it *does* match me well (the extra yellow helps) and because the formula works for my skin and application technique. I do apply something extra with it (usually medium weight moisturizer, whereas otherwise I just use a lightweight one), but my skin does dry out easily. 

Mixing/layering with creams/serums/primers might make it to where you can use up the bottle. Or it may work better as a spot concealer with you. I would definitely try applying too-little and building from there, it's not a single-layer foundation. If it still doesn't work, then it doesn't play nice with your skin. I would suggest selling it to someone else in-country if it's just not happening. "
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Are you looking for light, medium, or heavy coverage?"
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,That stinks!!
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"I only use the primer about half the time, though. It doesn’t make a difference :/"
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,It seems to work okay as a kind of thin base layer when applied in really small patches at a time. I might go ahead and sell it after a few more tries! 
Makeup,Anyone else not impressed with Fenty Beauty Pro Filt'r Soft Matte Foundation?,"Light and medium. I have a mild skin condition that causes redness. I layer any foundation, but this one does layer well for me at all. It doesn’t matter if I do or don’t use my silicone primer or if I blend with a damp beauty blender or a dry one. I’m going to try what others recommended- to mix with something creamier. "
Makeup,Does Fenty Beauty Invisimatte powder work on skin with no makeup?,I use it on bare skin all the time. It cuts the shine very well.
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"I’ve tried it and it’s not terrible. I can see how people would like the mascara (thickens lashes pretty nicely). But for me it wasn’t enough length/volume compared to some other mascaras I like. However, I feel like this mascara reminds me of the yellow Maybelline Colossal mascara but without the flaking and it doesn’t come off as easily! That mascara used to be my favorite drugstore one but, if I’m going to pay $24 for a mascara I will grab something else. I also like my mascara to come off easily with my cleansing balm and this one I feel like I have to work a little extra to get it off. The staying power of the mascara is great though!! Just a preference thing."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Mascaras work differently on everyone. Some of the youtubers I watch have mentioned liking it. I don’t think it’s a universally hated product like the colorful liquid liners.
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,I bought it and I actually really like it. It was clumpy at first but because it’s a flat brush you just have to use it properly as it’s unlike other mascaras.
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Just get an Essence mascara tbh
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Pictures are deceiving. I've seen reviews about it. Tutorials. And it looks pretty good to me
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"I thought I was going to be a flop too. But my friend got me as a gift and holy shit! I have the shortest of the short Asian lashes and I'm impressed. I know some people don't like their mascara on a drier side but if you have short stubborn lashes, it works in your favor!"
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,There are a number of overhyped fenty products. I always try stuff from the brand because I like the inclusivity and the packaging design but a lot of products have fallen short for me. I think everyone just wants to like it because we all love Rihanna lol
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,For me personally it’d no different L’Oréal voluminous. I’d personally just stick with Maybelline falsies lift or like someone else said above essence lash princess!
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Mood it looks kinda cheep🤧
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,I like it but you have to be careful with the brush. It doesn't beat my bad gal by Benefit or the one I love by Essence.
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"Honestly I never buy high end mascara. You can almost always get a mini as a gwp or if your a sucker for the sephora favorites... Like me... They usually have at least one too.

If I do have to buy a full sized drugstore mascara is just as good. And for any high end mascara you love, I'm 90 percent sure you can find an exact dupe at CVS lol.


With that being said... I haven't even given the fenty mascara a second glance."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Great lash ftw
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,It’s honestly pretty nice mascara and my lashes look awesome when I use it (but I have long lashes to begin with). The one thing that I’ve noticed is I’ll get little dark patches underneath my eyes that are definitely mascara residue so that’s very frustrating. Never had any of my cheaper mascaras do that to me :/
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,It's a really great mascara. You have to be careful applying or it can get everywhere but I don't have great lashes and it gives both volume and length and without smudging or flaking.
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"I have it because I like insanity apparently lol.  Every so often a high-end mascara comes out that intreuges me for one reason or another and I think maybe this one will be different (what I mean by different is that I have yet to find a high end mascara that I reach for over my ride or die drug store ones) and will be worth the price tag.  I don't wear falsies, I have decent lashes and I don't mind taking my time and putting work into application.  While the brush is kinda cool, I still do not think that high end mascara is better then drugstore and this was just another affirmation of it.  It was OK, nothing more, wasn't horrible (it hasn't been very long so this could dry out and go tits up within a month).    Moral of the story, stick with the drugstore, literally anything from essence is a quarter of the price and the worst one is just as good as the fenty, just OK. 

Ps..... I do have higher standards for a mascara that costs 4 or 5 times as much.  It has to wow me to justify it, I think I'm in the majority in my thinking."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"It’s pretty good! It doesn’t give as much volume as Stilla Huge extreme lash mascara or lash paradise, but the lashes look defined and hold the curl! I find the brush interesting as it has two ways of using it."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"I have it, and I have to say that it's so far my favorite mascara. Well, I prefer it over the Better than Sex and the KVD Go Big Or Go Home.

It's not clumpy, I can put it on my bottom lashes, which I stopped doing years ago because I always had big ulgy lumps.

But, maybe my other mascara choices were bad, and this one is ""better""."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"Agreed. I bought it and it’s not amazing but it’s also not terrible. It is a bit on the drier side but not necessarily in a bad way.  To your point, I’ve tried probably 5 or 6 Essence mascaras and they all been total flops for me."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Why do people hate the liquid liners? I was thinking about getting one
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"How do you use it? I just got a mini and I’ve been using the edges, not sure how to use the flat side!"
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,the Essence mascara is ridiculously good
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,Yess they’re my favourite
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"They give a big effect but always smudge on me, and other mascaras dont 

Edit: at first i thought i only used lash princess, but i also used other essence mascaras, so... :("
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"From the reviews I saw, they were patchy and flaked. Lesha did a good video on them."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"Just the colorful ones, FYI—the black Flyliner is pretty popular."
Makeup,Is it just me or the Fenty Beauty Full Frontal mascara looks like a big flop?,"I find that it can transfer v easily so I’ll turn it to the flat side and far from my eyelid, brush my lashes up with the brush head being horizontal if that makes sense? Harder to explain without a demo!"

Makeup,Dupe for Fenty Beauty lip gloss shade Fuchsia Flex,Try revolution shimmer gloss on there website
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,I really liked the compact setting powder it’s worth a rebuy to me every time
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,I LOVE the cream lip glosses! I fond they act as  stain to a degree too! I have not tried their actual stains yet.... I bought 6 cream glosses right before they announced the stains  so I just can't justify spending more atm lol.
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,What do you like about it?
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,It just makes my face matte and takes the oil away but my makeup underneath is still visible so it doesn’t take away any color.
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,So it's a regular translucent powder?
Makeup,Best Fenty Beauty products?,Yes a translucent powder.
Makeup,"A lighter, cooler toned contour stick than Fenty Beauty's 'Fawn'?",I've not compared the two but the creme bronzer in Amber from. Fenty is pretty grey.
Makeup,"A lighter, cooler toned contour stick than Fenty Beauty's 'Fawn'?","Edited: Added photo and explanation

Nars Cream Bronzer in Laguna 01 is lighter but has about the same coolness. Also, Patrick Ta, She's statuesque is lighter but not quite as cool.

I added a photo comparison for you. I also added a warmer, more orange color by Colourpop for comparison purposes.

Makeup,Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Longwear Hydrating Foundation Issues,"I have this foundation and had similar issues and think I finally figured out how to work it… so first I apply my rosehip oil all over my face (then I might add a glowy sunscreen) but the key is: mix the foundation with moisturizer!! Idk what science magic happens but it is different than applying in separate steps! Usually I forego powder but I’ve read a tip to use your sponge to press in powder too? Also I have Fenty’s matte primer and I think it’s important to note the kind of finish your primer has. I have combo skin so if I do use primer, I’ll only use it on my oily parts cause if I use it on my drier areas it won’t look great. Hope that makes sense/helps!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Longwear Hydrating Foundation Issues,"I use it and find it to be pretty mediocre, but to deal with how cakey it is, after I apply it with a foundation brush I dampen a sponge and go over my face with the sponge. Doing so absorbs some of the excess foundation and makes it sit better on my skin."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Longwear Hydrating Foundation Issues,"Damp sponge.  I also mix my primer in with it.   Then apply the powder in specific areas.

I also enjoy mixing it with my matte foundations to the hydration and more staying power."
Makeup,Charlotte tilbury VS Fenty beauty foundation??,Which Charlotte tilbury and which fenty foundation? They are all wildly different
Makeup,Charlotte tilbury VS Fenty beauty foundation??,Tbh I don’t think either of these foundations are super great but Charlotte tilbury by a mile.  I don’t like the fenty complexion products - even the one meant for drier skin just does a lot of clinging/settling. If you have oily skin you may have a different experience.
Makeup,Charlotte tilbury VS Fenty beauty foundation??,"Already bought 2 bottles of Charlotte Tilbury Airbrush Flawless foundation, will always be my favorite. Good coverage, it lives up to its name and I get compliments and questions which foundation I am using because its so smooth!"
Makeup,Rare Beauty or Fenty Beauty tinted moisturizer for my skin type,"Based on your description, I don't think the Fenty one would work. It may cling to your ezema and dry spots and works best on oily skin I think. Not sure about Rare, but I would recommend the Beauty Blender tint, although it is on the dewy side."
Makeup,Rare Beauty or Fenty Beauty tinted moisturizer for my skin type,"I have both. The rare beauty tint has a dewy finish to it, while I feel like the fenty one is more matte. I also have combination skin and prefer the rare beauty tint because it feels really nice, has spf, and I feel as though it looks more natural on me than the fenty skin tint does. In areas where it looks a little more dewy than I’d prefer, I put a little bit of powder over it"
Makeup,Rare Beauty or Fenty Beauty tinted moisturizer for my skin type,"If you want hydration and have eczema the fenty skin tint is not for you. The rare beauty might be a little too dewy if you get really oily, but I find that the finish is super natural and gorgeous."
Makeup,Rare Beauty or Fenty Beauty tinted moisturizer for my skin type,I have Fenty and it works great on oily skin but might cling to dry patches (I have eczema as well but not on my face) if you want something more moisturizing and dewy Ilia sunscreen serum is nice. I love it but it does make my t-zone shiny so I have to blot/powder often even with primer.
Makeup,Rare Beauty or Fenty Beauty tinted moisturizer for my skin type,"not fenty please it made my combination skin very very patchy even with flawless filter and moisturizer underneath, i’m using milk makeup sunshine skin tint it’s really glowy and pretty and contains spf also i heard amazing stuff about the laura mercier one"
Makeup,too faced maximum plump lip plumper or fenty beauty heat?,"The too faced one is more intense than the fenty one, the fenty one feels more like a warm peppery/cinnamony burn compared to the toofaced one thag feels more like pins and needles to me. U get more plump the more irritating it feels tho lol"
Makeup,fenty beauty foundation recs,"Hi! I have dry skin, and the Eaze Drop really didn’t work well on me. I wanted to like it so badly because I had heard so many good things, but it ended up clinging to all of my dry patches! I feel like I usually hear people recommend the Eaze Drop for people with normal to oily skin and the Hydrating Longwear for people with dry skin, so maybe that one would be more suitable? But it’s also totally possible that I just didn’t prep my skin well enough and that the Eaze Drop will work better for you!"
Makeup,fenty beauty foundation recs,"My sister in law has dry skin and she can’t wear any Fenty foundation. I have combination skin and I like the Eaze drops and hydrating foundation. 

The hydrating foundation isn’t hydrating at all. It’s more of a natural finish that could be matte depending on skin type. Does it have to be Fenty? Because there’s other dry skin friendly foundations."
Makeup,fenty beauty foundation recs,"Nars has a nice color range and would probably work better with dry skin. I have normal to slightly oily skin and the Eaze drop separated and clung to whatever dry patches I had. I exfoliated, moisturized, and prepped my skin to try again with same results. Tried the pro filtr line and it came out worse. I think any line from Nars (especially Radiant Longwear) works best with combo/dry skin. Hope this helps!"
Makeup,fenty beauty foundation recs,i like fenty’s colour range a lot since i have an inbetween skin colour and it fits me better than most of the foundations but i’d love to hear other recs for dry/sensitive skin if you have any!!
Makeup,fenty beauty foundation recs,Fenty does have a good color range i agree. What’s the coverage level you want and what’s your price range?
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I just picked up the foundation and highlighter yesterday. Have nothing but good things to say, I am a pale girl but the foundation color options are amazing, usually the problem for me is that foundation shades for pale skin make me look pink, but I picked up the shade 120 and it's amazing. The consistency isnt too heavy and it gives you full coverage, Im just wearing it today for the first time so I can update you on how it works out through out the day for oily skin. I also liked the highlighter i believe the shade i picked up is called ""more money"" it's a very nice gold color and blends in very well. :) "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"A must buy! I bought the brush, primer, foundation, gloss, and a highlighter. The primer with the foundation is magic. I have oily skin and usually to blot 3 or more times a day but with Fenty I only have to blot once! My new HG. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I picked up the lip gloss and some foundation samples and I love them both! The foundation is a little bit similar to wet n wilds photofocus to me in the way that it is very thin and dries down matte, but I do really prefer the wear on the Fenty a little bit more. The gloss has a scent which I was wary of because I'm very sensitive to scents but it doesn't bother me and the effect is beautiful. It smooths over lips and gives a really pretty plump look and it works great over liners and lipsticks as well it is also very conditioning. Ive used it all day for about 4 days and each time it lasted until I wiped it off and left my lips feeling like I used a nice lip treatment. I tried one of the duo highlights but I didn't buy it(yet). They looked really beautiful on the skin and gave a shimmery glow but they weren't super reflective and metallic so I wouldn't recommend them if that's what you like. 

Overall I liked everything I've tried enough to want to purchase!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I have the lip gloss and one of the shimmer match sticks. I wish the stick was creamier because I'm having a hard time figuring the best way to apply it as a highlighter. Very pretty though. Excited to pick up some more items. 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I got the gloss and I love it! It smells like fruit punch, a refreshing change from all the cupcake/vanilla scents. It's supposed to be universal so it should look good on everyone. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I got the gloss bomb also and I have worn it every day since the day I bought it. I'm not really a lip gloss type of person but this on is moisturizing and looks great with very little effort. One swipe and you're set. I'd definitely recommend it 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I bought Trophy Wife, the Killawatt duo in Mean Money and Hu$tla Baby, the Lip gloss and a shimmer stick in Sinamon.  I have two samples of the foundation. And I think I will get the blotting powder or blotting sheets (as I'm someone that loves blotting papers)! Everything is amazing. The only thing I didn't like from the line from playing around at Sephora (I've gone there three times since the launch and always play around with the products and I make sure to get colour matched each time just to see if a different Sales Associate matches me to a different shade) is the concealer sticks. It didn't suit me under my eye at all, but I didn't try it elsewhere. The contour colour was fine though and wore nicely, but I won't buy it because I recently bought the Smashbox contour/foundation duo stick. 

The foundation is nice and the colour range it comes in is definitely a major strongpoint of the collection, but in my opinion the highlighters and shimmer sticks are the main attraction. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,Loveee the highlighters and the gloss.  
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I picked up the blotting powder, mostly because I'm an oily lady and I've been trying to find a great pressed powder to bring around with me! I also got a sample of the foundation, but I don't have a clear opinion on it yet. The pressed powder, however, is amazing! It really blurs my pores and mattifies my skin, my boyfriend actually noticed how shine-free I looked after applying it. I don't use it as a setting powder, however, mostly for powdering my face a bit when I'm out or at work. The little pouf thing works well too, and the powder doesn't cake up when I use it this way or change the color of my foundation. Highly recommend it if you or anyone is concerned with oiliness!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I picked up the foundation (110, perfect match for my pale skin) and the highlight in Lightning Dust. I love the foundation - it has great coverage without being heavy and doesn't sink in to my fine lines as bad as some foundations do. 

Im going to return the highlight because it's too glittery for my taste. I prefer a more subtle highlight than this one. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I haven't gotten them yet, but I ordered online for the match sticks trio in light 100. So I get linen, amber and star struck. They look gorgeous, I'd been looking for some nice contouring sticks like this. Will update on arrival."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I got a deluxe sample of the foundation with a Sephora order and I've worn it for the past few days.  Wears well, great color match, and yesterday my husband told me that my skin looked really radiant.  I'll take it.  

I'd bought another brand of foundation recently and wasn't totally sold on it, and now I'm 100% sure that I'm going to return it and get this instead.  "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,Update: gave the highlighter one more shot today and changed my mind. I'm keeping it. LOL. 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I have the highlighter in Lightning Dust/Fire Crystal and Metal Moon and I think they're really lovely. I feel like I always have a good makeup day when I'm wearing them. The only drawback is I feel like I have to use quite a bit of product to get my desired look (glowing to the gods). The lip gloss is perfection, and that is coming from someone who never wears lipgloss. I've seen it look amazing on porcelain skin and rich chocolate skin. I also have the Match Stix in Ivory. I was excited about using it as a base for a no makeup look, but it really didn't last well on my skin (with primer, setting powder, setting spray). I'm going to play with it with more primers to see if that helps, but it might be better for under eye use."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"Hey! I am a youtuber but I bought it with my own money!! The foundation is everything, its matte but it goes on to the skin smooth and flawlessly. It is also super light weight. If you have oily to combination skin the foundation may oxidize, meaning get darker. So try getting one shade lighter. I did a review on a few other products, definitely check it out. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCZvlwAVxhrKepCMX7Uh40w?view_as=subscriber"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I'm glad you finally found your shade!! And yes, please, can you let me know how it holds up? My skin is really oily too."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,[deleted]
Makeup,Fenty Beauty," So, I'm assuming shade #120 is more of a neutral? Like, not too pink or too yellow based? I need to try some of that if that's the case!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I've heard it oxidizes, did you experience a color change?"

Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"That is great news, really! My skin is super oily and more often than not I have to blot about 45 minutes after I finish doing my make up, it's very annoying."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I've seen that the shimmer sticks are better applied with a brush for the same reason that they're not as creamy; see if that helps! :)
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,Wow! Def going to check this out -- I'm in the market for a powder to carry in my purse.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"Im at a wedding today, and im impressed! Ive been wearing this foundation for around 5 hours and still dont feel the need to put some matte powder!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"Sorry, never worn mac :( I normally wear too faced born this way in the shade Almond"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"I think it is permanent, but even if it isn't, rumor has it that they have 2 years' worth of stock."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"Definitely take a look at it! Try it in store first though, for my friend with drier skin she finds it dries her out more than it would for me"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty now at Ulta!,I went on launch day and spent $200 in points I’d been saving 😄
Makeup,Fenty Beauty now at Ulta!,Glad to see it🤗
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,"I thought Fenty took payment up front? Check your bank statement and see if you have the withdrawal recorded. 

Yeah, they don’t respond to their emails. Best thing you can do is get on the phone with them. Be warned that the jingle doesn’t change when they’re connecting you to a live customer service rep, so you won’t hear audio confirmation you’re being sent to a rep. Be prepared to wait a bit. It took me about ten minutes to get in touch with someone, and someone else I talked to 20. But once you get in contact with them, they are really nice and helpful. The person I talked to resolved my issue in minutes."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,"Just for future reference, it costs companies a whole lot more money to try and sue a single person, than it would to cut their loss of $100. It's not morally right, but if you just did nothing, they wouldn't waste the time to sue you. If you paid via PayPal, they can just open a dispute and... That's basically it. If you paid via a debit or a debit-credit card (not a sole credit card) then they honestly cannot do anything. Source: I worked in collections for 8 years."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,At least you ended up getting the stuff for free 💕💕
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,"I mean, it’s kind of your fault. Everything is running a little slower because of *reasons*. You shouldn’t have assumed that everything was fine until the transaction was complete. 

Review your statements. If they indeed never took the money from them, you owe them $102. If your account shows that they took the money out and it was never refunded back to you, then provide them with those details."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,I don’t think so loll. I still need to contact them on Monday. I don’t know what’s going to happen! I don’t mind on a compromise. But if not that’s  alright. ❤️
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,It’s not the fact it was going slower. It’s the fact they cancelled the processing. That isn’t really based on what’s going on right now. They then asked a month later after the money was supposed to be taken out. It’s not like they just didn’t keep the money to the side. They did. But something happened on their end to make it come back to my account.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,And I assumed the transaction was completed because I received the items. No where have I shopped where I pay after the items are received. Especially after a month.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,"Yes, you cancelled the order and they probably assumed that you would return the products. If you hadn’t intervened there would likely be no problem.  I’m suggesting that the shipping and email correspondence may have been slower than usual."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,"Traditionally, most places don’t charge your card until the item ships out. I think if you hadn’t tried cancelling the order they wouldn’t be billing you for it now, it would have processed as normal."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,They didn’t see the emails. Read the update.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,Glad it’s almost resolved then. I’m sure the Fenty looks great!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Confusion,❤️❤️
Makeup,Fenty beauty hydrating foundation over Milk makeup’s hydro grip primer,"I was using them both for a while, and I couldn’t figure out why they would look terrible together! So I guess now I know why! I’ll try mixing a silicone based primer to milk hydro grip and see if it makes it better"
Makeup,Fenty beauty hydrating foundation over Milk makeup’s hydro grip primer,Let me know how it goes!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Plush Matte Lipstick?,I’m sure they’re being discontinued. They’ve been on sale like that/out of stock for over a year now I think.
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"It should be called glitter bomb lol. If you like to be covered in glitter, you’ll probably love it, but I personally prefer a metallic powder over glitter. I love Ofra and Jouer highlighters. Also the Too Faced you’re so jelly highlighters are beautiful if you prefer a wet product"
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"Its a glitter bomb, have no doubts about it ! How many carats has a sheer base with a LOT of micro-fine silver/gold/pink glitter that predominantly looks silver on the skin. It's bright for sure. I absolutely love it but a ""healthy, lit from within glow"" it is not."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"If you want glitter pieces, the diamond bomb is perfect. But it's not a natural glow at all, better for on camera youtubers. If you wanted something a little subtler but still buildable to a disco ball, the Dior Nude Luminizer Glow Powder might be a good match. It's about 10$ more, so definitely not cheap. But it's a great highlight. And I still have love for my becca highlighters."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"OH MY GOD YES. I have really textured skin and the only way to put on highlighter for me is to use glittery ones, because it doesn't emphasize my scars. I literally finished it and I'm waiting to buy it again."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"I love this product. I’d say it’s worth it because it’s so unique, I don’t have any other highlighters like it and I own a lot of highlighters. I think you just need to be aware it’s purely glitter. Very fine, shiny glitters with no color. It’s not chalky at all, it’s smooth and soft. Definitely worth its price, imo.

If glitter isn’t your preference, I’d recommend any Ofra highlighter because they’re just as shiny. I own Ofra Glazed Donut highlighter and it’s extremely shiny."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"If you're okay with glitter, then sure! Actually, looking from far away, the highlighter definitely looks very wet and blinding, but up close you can tell that there are glitter particles. The highlighter itself has an interesting texture and glides on smoothly imo. You may get a little bit of glitter in different places as glitter does, but it's a good highlighter if you're okay with all that. I personally prefer it for the body, imo it's too overkill for the face, but it does also look nice as an eyeshadow topper."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"I haven’t tried gently highlighters yet, but if you’re looking for a transparent/champagne base with colorful micro shimmers, I highly recommend JD glow - 
My favorite is chaos (champagne, pink and orange) 
The texture is almost creamy. The color is gorgeous.  Ideally I would love to find something similar but without any micro glitter.
Btw JD glow highlighters are much much cheaper."
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,Artist couture is nice shimmer style if you're after that. I dont care for glitter tho
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"I love it because I love glitter, and it’s possible to build it up until it looks blinding"
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,I love it. I’m a mom and rock it on my collarbone in the summer and the way the light hits it is so pretty.
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,"As long as it’s not chalky, i’d like to give it a try! Would you say it gives off a smooth finish rather than a dry one?"
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,Becca highlighters are the best! Seriously so dewey and pretty.
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,A smooth finish for sure.
Makeup,Is the diamond bomb (how many carats) highlighter by fenty beauty worth buying?,Yes it is super smooth! Almost looks wet when the light hits it at an angle~
Makeup,What’s a good alternative to Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation 185?,"Is there a reason you’re using Amazon? Because it’s more expensive than the Fenty website, only $2 but still. Before I used Fenty I used Revlon Colorstay Foundation for combo/oily skin. I really liked the formula but it was just not a good color match for me. Wet n Wild Photo Focus was another good one but just had a smell and not the right shade"
Makeup,What’s a good alternative to Fenty Beauty Pro Filt’r Soft Matte Longwear Foundation 185?,I can't say if it's a dupe but the Maybelline Fit Me foundation (Matte + Poreless) is one of the best foundation ever... if not the best.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,"Try a wet sponge; with high coverage, matte foundations there is a high chance it will become streaky. And use as little as possible, work in sections. And try a hydrating primer underneath, that could help also. If you dare, you could also add a tiny drop of oil (gasp!). Don’t try a brush, that will add more coverage and makes things worse in my experience. Well, maybe a stippling brush. I didn’t like the Fenty foundation either by the way. You can mix it in with a light coverage bb cream to get the most out of your money. 

I have the same skin issues as you and I have about ten matte, streaky foundations... 

side note: since adding a lot of light hydrating layers to my skin care my skin has become less oily over the years."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,"I have this foundation (use it for work) and have repurchased it.  I always do major skin prep for any high coverage matte foundation.   I use a very hydrating moisturizer (cerave) and hydrating primer (Fenty).  Sometimes I’ll mix the foundation and primer together for a bb cream look.  Then I use a damp sponge to apply a thin layer.  then i add an extra layer over parts i need more coverage.   This will help with the non matching color.  BTW with matte long lasting foundations, going in too thick will result in looking patchy, streaky, and all that.  Best to do layers.  then apply very thin layer of powder over my oily bits.   

I have neutral light slightly golden skin and my perfect pre~covid match was 190.

This foundation when done this way does not transfer or budge for me!  ( i have very oily skin and live in very humid hot Texas heat. )"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,So @pennylane_9 what’s the verdict? Fenty soft matte is a hit or miss? Also what are you using now?
Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,"I thought that was my hg foundation too before but then when I tried out the hydrating version, and tried the soft matte again, i loved the hydrating more. Im just new to makeup so I didnt know how diff foundations felt so when i compared the hydrating to the soft matte, the soft matte completely dried out my face as compared to the hydrating one. 

I also watched Fenty’s global MUA Priscilla Ono do makeup on clients using the soft matte foundation and realized she did a lot of skin prep before using the foundation meaning she knew that the foundation would be very drying on her clients."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty soft matte foundation-- what the hell am I doing wrong?!,"Fenty soft matte is a total miss for me. I’ve done a lot of trial and error in the last 3 years and learned a lot and these are my favorites:

- [Laura Mercier Oil-Free Tinted Moisturizer](https://www.sephora.com/product/tinted-moisturizer-broad-spectrum-oil-free-P140906) and [Laura Mercier Pure Canvas Blurring Primer](https://www.sephora.com/product/laura-mercier-pure-canvas-primer-blurring-floutant-P454941). The shade 1N2 Vanille is a good match for me (it pulls cool) and the primer is a decent mattifying base. I use the [Laura Mercier Secret Camouflage Duo Stick Concealer](https://www.nordstrom.com/s/secret-camouflage-correct-and-brighten-concealer-duo-stick/5736361) in both 1C and 2C depending on the time of year, however Sephora doesn’t carry it anymore and I have to go to Nordstrom to pick it up. Top it all off with some [Laura Mercier Ultra-Blur Setting Powder](https://www.sephora.com/product/ultra-blur-translucent-loose-setting-powder-P500622) and I’m good to go.

- recently I’ve been using and loving the [Carpe Sweat-Absorbing Mattifying Primer](https://mycarpe.com/products/face-primer-spf-30). I saw it on Instagram, which I’m usually super against, and was compelled to try it because not only am I super oily, I also have the wild talent of sweating profusely for no fucking reason. It’s AMAZING. It’s matte but not inhumanly so, absorbs 90% of my sweat (and my days are spent running around in the sun carrying things), has SPF 30, and is super easy to work with. It also pairs nicely with my [Armani Luminous Silk Foundation](https://www.sephora.com/product/luminous-silk-foundation-P393401) and [Armani Luminous Silk Concealer](https://www.sephora.com/product/giorgio-armani-beauty-luminous-silk-concealer-P456158) in shades 5.1 and 4.75, respectively. They’re both pretty pricey but a little goes a long way and the color match is perfect for me. I finish with the same Laura Mercier setting powder and [Morphe Continuous Setting Mist](https://www.ulta.com/p/continuous-setting-mist-xlsImpprod18351117?sku=2528888)."

Makeup,FENTY BEAUTY POWDER FOUNDATION or CHARLOTTE TILBURY AIRBRUSH POWDER? Ive hit pan on my CT and planning to buy new one but its so expensive! saw fenty came out w new ones.. in dry skin and i love airbrush powder but its too expensive :( any thoughts?,"MAC Studiofix Powder foundation. Not only cheaper than Fenty, but includes a little more product, and a 54 color shade range. My Holy Grail foundation since 1992."
Makeup,FENTY BEAUTY POWDER FOUNDATION or CHARLOTTE TILBURY AIRBRUSH POWDER? Ive hit pan on my CT and planning to buy new one but its so expensive! saw fenty came out w new ones.. in dry skin and i love airbrush powder but its too expensive :( any thoughts?,I bought my CT powder new on Poshmark for 2/3 of the price...look on resale sites for a discount!

Ive hit pan on my CT and planning to buy new one but its so expensive! saw fenty came out w new ones.. in dry skin and i love airbrush powder but its too expensive :( any thoughts?,"They're both really great products, but if you're really set on your CT powder try mecari app. I've been buying my huda beauty, Mac, too faced, fenty, and CT products on there.. I love to try different makeup products! Anyway, you'll find new unopened products for 15-18 dollars less than the normal price. You can also make your own offer, and see if the seller bites.. 9 times out of ten, they do!"

Ive hit pan on my CT and planning to buy new one but its so expensive! saw fenty came out w new ones.. in dry skin and i love airbrush powder but its too expensive :( any thoughts?,"makeup forever matte velvet is amazing, recommend u check it out forgot the price tho"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"I have normal to oily skin, but I love a good hydrating foundation. The Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation unfortunately missed the mark for me. I just looked like a greaseball when wearing it, and it settled in my smile lines so quickly, even with powdering. Overall I really didn't like the foundation at all, which was so disappointing, but I exchanged it for the original matte Fenty Beauty foundation. It's kind of dry but if you pair it with the Fenty hydrating primer, it looks exquisite on the skin."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"Ive been dying to try this, I’ve seen so many reviews saying that it is too dewy 😭😭😭"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,I have normal skin and I’m obsessed with this foundation. It wears on me all day and looks hydrating and beautiful. As long as you set it with powder the foundation should be fine. If you have a sephora near you I’d suggest getting a sample!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"I have combo skin (dry patches/texture but also oily in some places) and I love this foundation. Good amount of coverage, excellent shade range, and I didn’t find it too dewy at all. I like it alot because it doesn’t emphasize my texture. I recommend applying it with a sponge because I found it going streaky when using a brush. My favorite thing to do is mix it with the ABH foundation and apply with a sponge but it’s also lovely just on its own. I recommend getting a sample from Sephora and trying it out to see for yourself because I do think it’s a very polarizing product."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"Huh. I have dry skin, and I’ve been loving it so far! I haven’t noticed anything really about it being too dewey, but I actually really like that look. I also moisturize heavily before applying makeup, use almost exclusively hydrating products for the face, and don’t set with powder- so if anyone would be significant dewey it’d be me lol"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,Which hydrating foundations do you prefer? I’m always on the lookout a good hydrating formula but have never been able to find one that suits me 🤷🏻‍♀️
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"Which is hilarious cos it's totally matte on me and very  thick. Or it's kind a clings and creates dry patches, like bad ones but there's some wierd sheen on top. It was horrible aside form shade range"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"I’ve really enjoyed the new Anastasia foundation! Also I’m not sure if this counts as hydrating, but NARS sheer glow always looks gorgeous and dewy on the skin."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,"I completely agree with this. it's kind of like an old technology hydrating foundation, in that it relies upon thickness and an inability to set to be 'hydrating' and just doesn't have the lighweight, fluid and buildable feel that many hydrating foundations nowadays seem to have."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,My all time fave is an old school hydrating foundation that doesn't set. (it's the Onyl foundation that I can use without moisturiser or primer beforehand). Fenty is def not ine fo those.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty hydrating foundation thoughts?,good for you. I'm just sharing my experience with the fenty foundation.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mascara,"I love this mascara!! I do wear a lash primer under but even when I didn’t it still looks really nice. I usually use the flat side for length, I don’t usually use the thicker side because I think it can sometimes clump it or make my lashes too thick (I prefer long lashes over voluminous). I do think you may need to brush your lashes after cuz if you put too much it can clump easily, but it really lengthens your lashes and once you learn how to maneuver it it really makes your lashes look nice."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mascara,"I use the Marc Jacobs lash primer! I usually use the Marc Jacobs, the Fenty and then the Essence Get Big Volume Boost mascara and my lashes are good to go. The essence one is really good and would probably work by itself too!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mascara,"the one you use, is it Marc Jacobs Velvet Noir Major Volume Mascara?"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mascara,Yes!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Mascara,Of course! I hope you enjoy it! The brush is really amazing and helps lengthen and is very voluminous.

Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,"I had the same concerns about the mean money duo but once it's on it actually pulls more of a pretty rose gold, at least on me!"
Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,"I haven't tried the duos, but I have wattabrat and ruby richez and I adore them, I also had the hustla baby mini and I found it to be a beautiful rose gold. I'm 105 in her foundation so I have yellow undertones. I think the killawatts have a flakey-ness to them and the glitter tends to get everywhere but they blend really well"
Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,"I’m a similar shade (fair-light with warm undertones) and I actually own 3 of the Freestyle Highlighter Duos (Lightning Dust/Fire Crystal, Girl Next Door/Chic Phreak And Mean Money/Hu$tla Baby) because I love the formula and shades so much, but MM/HB is my favourite. Probably one of my favourite highlighters in my whole collection. 

Mean money is a light, pearly gold which is more of a subtle, wearable sheen for everyday and Hu$tla baby is a more intense, metallic peachy gold. I prefer Hu$tla baby as I like a blinding highlight, but sometimes I like to mix the two shades. 

LD/FC is not too frosty or light, I enjoy this one as well. I like using GND/CP as a shimmery blush or blush topper with my matte blushes."
Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,I’m NC15 and have lightening dust/fire crystal. I loooove it. It’s a perfect skin tone match for me.
Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,"ooo, how do you use the Ruby richez? I loooove the shade but am struggling to figure out how I would use it given that I am not employed as a model hahaha"
Makeup,fenty beauty highlighter shade selection?,No problem! I def recommend them :) You could wait till the Sephora sale and get both. I think there’s usually one in April/May
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I don’t recommend using matte foundation for dry skin. Get a hydrating one instead. I believe the standard foundation has 30 ml.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,The matte one is very dry. I haven’t tried the other yet.  I have combo skin and the dry is dry....
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"The matte one will definitely make your dry skin a bit more obvious. It was too matte for me even with my oily summer skin. I have combo skin now  and I just recently tried the hydrating one because the employee told me it was good for combo skin. It was a big no for me. Went on beautifully but my T zone was all a mess after 5 hours. It never really sets so if you don’t like that feeling you’d have to wear a powder. 

IMO fenty is decent but not the greatest for foundation. I have better luck buying drugstore foundation."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I have dry skin and even the hydrating foundation was too drying for me. I'd stay far away from the matte one.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,Go into a physical shop to try the 2 side by side
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"Put a good moisturizer on and non drying sunscreen.  Let it soak in.  Then hydrating primer.   Then mix the matte foundation with the hydrating primer and apply with damp sponge.  It will give you what you need for dry skin.

Don’t cake it on.  This works best in thin layers and gives me great natural coverage."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,"This is probably not the most helpful as I cant specify which foundation I bought, but I got it just after she first launched fenty and it was super, super dry. I could only use a tiny bit mixed with primer right after moisturising. I know she got a lot of praise for the colours, but the formula just wasn't cutting it for me."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,I was asking if I should buy the fenty hydrating primer with the soft matte foundation.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty,That won't help because the foundation would still be way too dry even if you put the most moisterizing primer underneath it
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Match Stix Matte Skinstick,"Ummm. I have them and love them. They are meant for highlighting and contouring, so play time is really short and set to powder. Don't get me wrong, I use it as foundation too, when I travel. Since the play time is so short, I like to section them, like ""draw"" on the forehead blend, ""draw"" on left cheek blend, etc. Personally I like Huda beauty foundation stick, it has more play time and set beautifully. Using good old flat foundation brush gives the best application in my opinion."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Match Stix Matte Skinstick,You need to let it warm up first if you’re going to draw on your face like that.  I prefer to just run my brush or finger over the stick and apply it that way instead of drawing on the face.  It gives me more control and blend ability
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Powder Foundation vs BareMinerals BarePro Powder Foundation,"I haven’t tried those but MAC Studiofix Powder foundation comes in either 52 or 54 colors, contains slightly more product than Fenty and costs a few dollars less. It’s been my Holy Grail foundation for over 20 years."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Matchstick Amber dupe?,I hear good things about Pixi sheer sculpt!  They’re $6 at the moment.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Matchstick Amber dupe?,I am not sure if they still sell it but the Jordana Contour Stick is very good. They have a light very cool colour that should be similar to the fenty one.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Matchstick Amber dupe?,I don’t exactly remember but under 5$ I think
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Matchstick Amber dupe?,Oooh that sounds good. Do they have muitple shades maybe I could look at?
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Matchstick Amber dupe?,I think they only have that one contour shade.
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,Rub it on the back of your hand (to warm it up) and pick it up with the brush/sponge or rub the directly brush/sponge on the stick . This works best for me to get a more even application of stiffer products like the match sticks.
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,I would make sure that the areas where you apply it are moisturized so the matchsticks aren’t dragging on really dry skin. I don’t have any of them but I remember the reviews being not the best because they aren’t very easy to blend. You can also try to rub some off on your hand to warm it up and use a sponge or brush to pick up the warm product on your hand and apply it. Hope that helps!
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,I find that a firm buffing brush works way better than a sponge or fingers for the matte ones. I use the same one i blended my foundation with and now match sticks are part of my everyday!
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?," I use both my fingers and dabbing with a sponge to blend these. Super hard to make work but the colors are beautiful! 

Usually it looks something like:
Apply a small amount with stick straight to face.
Dab furiously with beauty sponge. 
Apply a bit more with fingers from stick (this warms the product a little). Blend by tapping furiously on face with fingers. 
Blend more by dabbing even more furiously with beauty sponge. Good luck!"
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,Rubbing it on the back of the hand works really well but such a waste of product.. so I agree with rubbing/dabbing the sponge or the brush directly on the stick! Much better than just painting the stick on to the face since it rubs of the make up underneath
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,Rubbing/dabbing the bursh does not have the advantage of the product warming up though.
Makeup,How to use Fenty Beauty Match Sticks properly?,It’s true that it warms up more when you rub it on the hand first but the product warms up when you work it into the skin with the brush or the sponge too. I really have no problem with it
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,"This is such a gorgeous red, very pigmented and lasts all day. Definitely would get it"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,The best liquid lipstick formula and the shade of red truly looks incredible on everyone. I am able to eat and not touch it up. Not too drying and doesn't emphasize chapped lips at all
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,I have the shade unbutton and I love it. I do not recommend just taking the applicator and swiping it on the lips to coat it. I don’t really do this with any liquid lipstick cos you don’t need that much and it’ll accentuate the fine lines on your lips. I just dot it on and then take my finger or brush and blend it in. It’s very long lasting and I find it doesn’t give me that white ring around my lips!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,"I have the color uncuffed, it’s a nice lipstick, it wears off throughout the day with eating etc, but I’ll wear it to work. It’s not too drying, it’s got rich color, and it’s comfy to wear"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,"It's such a gorgeous color. However I never wore it when I had it because it's a pain to apply. I always had to use a lip brush. You should also know it does not dry down completely and it does transfer. 

So the color is the #1 selling point but the formula is a pain. Temptalia has dupes if the formula is a concern to you!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Stunna Lippaint: Uncensored,"I love it! I have fair skin and I think it’s the perfect shade of red! I always remind myself “dot dot not a lot” haha because you don’t need a lot to get the pigment and amount needed to cover the lips. I will always wipe some product off of the applicator around the inside of the top bottle and line the lips then fill in the rest. (I don’t have a red lip liner at the moment haha) Love the applicator. It will smear but only if you deliberately rub your hand across your lips hahah I notice that very little comes off after eating (with a fork) and drinking (with a straw) on a night out. Definitely a fun, bold lip that looks good on a lot of people!"
Makeup,Dupe for Fenty Beauty,Sephora Collection - Black Cherry Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick might be pretty close.  They're AMAZING too.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??," The Fenty foundation isn't designed for dry skin. There are a few people here that mentioned that they exfoilated and used a good moisturizer and it still clung funny of their skin.

"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,Fenty foundation is really not meant for dry skin. If you bought it from Sephora I would bring it back and explain to an associate there was you're looking for in a foundation and let them help you find something that would work with your skin type and concerns. 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,Stephanie Nicole on youtube is dry skin also and made a video about it and how she got it to work - since you’ve bought it you may as well try to get your moneys worth! [She talks about the foundation at 7 mins or so ](https://youtu.be/dLj95bKMb_c) She works/knows a lot about the industry so I tend to trust her advice and guidance. Good luck! 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,I have dry skin in the winter and the beauty consultant said that Fenty wasn't going to be a good choice. She recommended Too Faced Born this Way and it's been working great for me! 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,"I had the same problem after using the sample, so I decided not to go for it. But if you really want to stick with the foundation, maybe you can try using a serum on the driest parts of your face beforehand or mixing the foundation with a serum. I've had a good experience with the Josie Maran argan oil serum mixed with some foundations/tinted moisturizers (not Fenty) - although the serum is pricey too: [at Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/product/100-percent-pure-argan-oil-P218700?skuId=1121797&om_mmc=ppc-GG_381463959_27499869519_pla-178160181159_1121797_97594833519_9032064_c&country_switch=us&lang=en&gclid=Cj0KCQiA1afSBRD2ARIsAEvBsNmFedX0oifBY56J1QJJyDPgvZP-7Bf1TigiBYJmF3M5XRZI5LHnOZYaAi96EALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,"I have the Catrice HD Liquid Coverage (it’s a formula dupe for the Fenty) and I also have dry skin with a somewhat oily T-Zone. I found that the best way to apply it is with a beauty sponge (Morphe sponges are my go to now). I have to exfoliate before hand (I’ve found the Biore baking soda one is pretty good and gentle) and use a generous amount of The Body Shop’s Vitamin E Intense Moisture Cream 72h. After I let that soak in for a bit, I use a more “slippy” primer (my primer of choice is the clear Smashbox Photo Finish Primer).

I hope this helps you out! If all else fails, I say return it to Sephora. Nothing is worse than keeping something when you hate the way it looks on you!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,Same problem. I think I’ll return and go back to haus of labs. LOVED it and didn’t make me feel or look dry.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,"Just a heads up with that, Fenty tends to oxidize on oily skin. It did it like crazy for me when I used serums/ oils (even the night before) and ever since then I have to get oil of my face before using it."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,Yeah I was pretty disappointed to find out (considering I was walking around with orange foundation that was not orange when I put it in lol). The coverage is amazing that’s why I put the effort in though.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,"Nooooo! That's the worst.

My best friend HIGHLY recommended it but I'm so glad I went for the sample first. I've been trying out new foundations/CC creams/tinted moisturizers every time I run out looking for a good staple for my skin and complexion. 

*Sigh* maybe one day......"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation and Dry Skin...What am I doing wrong??,"I hear that. I’m somewhat happy with the NYX stock foundation. It doesn’t cover as much as I would like though. But the price is fair and I use it to balance out when foundation doesn’t have the best match. I have been wanting to try the HD foundation. I tried the concealer and it was alright, but I saw videos where guys literally covered up facial hair with the foundation and that kinda makes me want to try it. Have you tried Sephora color IQ? The matches are not always spot on but close. You can sort products by skin type that way so maybe that will get you more suggestions for dry skin ! :))"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,This foundation is a soft matte finish definitely great for oily skin. If you have that type of skin I'm sure you'd love it. The primer I feel like there are other great ones that would do way more. The match sticks are a drier formula so if you have dry under eyes I don't recommend it.  The contour shades are really nice and cool toned but the formula is dry and it is more hard to blend. The highlights in my opinion are worth the money especially the Kill-a-wat duo. The beauty sponge is super soft but I think you'd be fine with the beauty blender.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"If you have oily or normal skin then I definitely recommend it! My nose is usually incredibly oily and today after ~7 hours of wear, I haven't had to blot at all! It's also the most natural looking foundation I've ever tried; after 2 layers it still looked very natural"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"Stay away if you have dry skin like I do, it literally makes my face burn because it's so drying. If I put on a heavy duty moisturiser underneath (I'm talking Cetaphil, Vaseline body) then it doesn't f my face up"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"I oily skin and I’ve used this five times now and it’s wonderful. Every time I’ve used it, I get compliments on how great my makeup looks! And the longevity of it is amazing. Highly recommend if your skin is oily! "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"i have combination skin and i love it, use a hydrating primer if you have dry spots. it feels like nothing which i love because i've just started wearing foundation instead of just under eye concealer "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"if you have fine lines/dry skin, it will settle into them if you are not careful. it will suck any oil out of your skin, so if you are oily, i would say go for it:) "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"As long as you have the skin type for it, or remember to heavily moisturise beforehand, it's worth it. The foundation is *incredible*. It's the best, most natural looking medium coverage foundation. And it's still buildable."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"Yes, I have combo skin. I make sure to moisturizer beforehand. Easily my new favorite foundation. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"I have dry skin and I adore the foundation! The formula is so light and easy to work with, and it lasts FOR EVER. I adore the match sticks too, especially the highlighters. They blend superbly!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,also does anyone have any thoughts about glossbomb from fenty? do you like it? im considering getting it 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,"It's apparently very drying for already dry skin , and although this post's replies say the opposite , some people have been saying that it's not great for very oily skin either. I'd definitely read up on it and test it before buying "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty. Is it worth it?,Awesome advice!!
Makeup,How to i find shade 260 Fenty Beauty in other more affordable foundation?,take a look at temptalia’s foundation matrix! should pop up if you just google it. great resource all around
Makeup,How to i find shade 260 Fenty Beauty in other more affordable foundation?,The Sephora app has a shade marcher! So as long as you know your colour for one brand it will match you with what it thinks is close :)
Makeup,How to i find shade 260 Fenty Beauty in other more affordable foundation?,You could try findation.com but it works better if you know some other foundations that are good matches for you.
Makeup,How to i find shade 260 Fenty Beauty in other more affordable foundation?,I second this. I've used it a couple of times and the shades recommendations are pretty spot on. Your results do change based on what foundations you include and exclude.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,"I’m definitely getting it. Fenty has been my absolute favorite. Every single thing I’ve got, from foundation to lip paint, is the best in my collection!!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,I have oily skin that unfortunately seems to be sensitive to most mattifying primers. I use the original Fenty primer because it's one of the few I've tried that doesn't break me out. I'm definitely interested in seeing if this one keeps me more matte without breaking me out.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,"If there's a mini or a sample up for grabs, I'll definitely try it. I'm always trying new primers to help with my oily tzone, and the fenty foundation works well for me"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,The foundation & Retouch primer is way too much for my dry skin. This one will have to be a pass. I'm sure it will be fantastic for oily skin as her face products already are.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,Agreed!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,Me too!!!!
Makeup,Fenty Beauty launched a new mattifying primer!,I can definitely see them not working for dry skin at all. I have oily skin and they're a dream.
Makeup,Huda foundation or fenty beauty foundation,"I have combo oily skin.

Huda is not even on my list. I tried it a couple times and it had to be one of the most unflattering foundations. It looked like really bad makeup and emphasized all the wrong things.

Fenty was ok,  but it took me a couple samples to get the right shade. It looked really good but I didn’t like how matte it was, I like a little sheen to come through.


I will splurge on some things but they really didn’t make me go “wow!”."
Makeup,Huda foundation or fenty beauty foundation,Fenty has a nice finish. It's just hard to match undertones to it.
Makeup,Huda foundation or fenty beauty foundation,Haven’t tried huda but I hated fenty. It oxidizes like crazy so you have to get a shade a few shades lighter and it’s too matte for my liking.
Makeup,Huda foundation or fenty beauty foundation,"I have sensitive fair skin and rosacea on my cheeks. I’m not acne prone but definitely look like a tomato without some sort of foundation. I haven’t tried fenty but I have huda in the shade “angel food”. It’s very full coverage but it oxidizes. The scent is almost overwhelming but it goes away by the time I put the rest of my makeup on. It’s drying and requires a very moisturized base. It looks lovely but it transfers even with setting powder and setting spray. Tbh, I go for my MUFE hd or Estée Lauder doublewear. To each their own, I guess!"
Makeup,Huda foundation or fenty beauty foundation,Just thought i’d let you know Fenty is dropping a hydrating foundation this month
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation Question,"Hi fellow glasses wearer here, I used to have this problem quite a bit no matter what foundation I used. So far the only things that have worked is using an eyeshadow primer on the parts of my face where my glasses would sit and then going slightly heavier on the powder after. Mac's paint pots are great for this hope this helps!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation Question,"For myself, I wait 30 minutes before I apply foundation after moisturizing. I use my primer all over my face and neck (except the eyes) and wait 2 minutes for my primer to set in. Some brands of primers work on some people, others not so much. Most primers are similar depending on formula, my personal preference is MAC and Rimmel. 

As for Fenty foundation, most raved about it, but there was some people here who had some complaints about breakouts, but that was rare. 

Do you use setting spray? That will definitely help from your foundation moving around. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation Question,I have found that applying the foundation with a little bit of moroccan oil on the drier areas of my face made the finish better and stoped it from moving around. 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation Question,The best one I've tried so far is the mac paint pot my shade is soft ochre though if you're fair your shade is likely to be painterly. I'd normally apply this first then foundation then powder on top my fav powder rn is Laura mercier or if you're on a budget the maybelline loose powder is pretty decent. And setting spray hope that helps :) 
Makeup,Fenty Beauty Foundation Question,"Yes. My makeup doesn't move around, my drugstore lipstick stayed on, despite the summer heat. I use Milani's setting spray; but you can use any kind you wish.

"
Makeup,Thoughts about the new Fenty beauty hydrating foundation?,"The only had experience I had with it was the first time I used it. I don't know if I just didn't massage the tube enough or if I used too much (probably that one), but I was super shiny all day even with mineral powder on top. I've cut what I would normally use of their matte foundation in half and that account works perfect with this one."

Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,"I like them! I think they last more than mac lipsticks but the application is a bit difficult, but a lip brush works! :) "
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,"I have the 100 point sample! I found it extremely pigmented but hard to apply from the tube, it seems to slip around a lot."
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,I sometimes apply lipstick with a finger to get a more natural matte finish. 
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,Hey can I ask what skin tone you are? (If you know your mac shade that’d be helpful) I’m thinking of buying this shade but I’m not sure how it might look! 
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,"Yes, I redeemed my 100 points for it at sephora.  The shade I have is pigmented but I found it hard to apply and it settles in the fine lines, makes lips look textured. I do not recommend purchasing it :)"
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,"I don’t know in Mac, but i know The Ordinary and there’s a conversion chart - 

The Ordinary Serum Foundation shade 2.1P 
[MAC Conversion Chart](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/68k1x8/the_ordinary_foundation_shades_mac_shades/) 

Generally I find Up 2 No Good is too light for medium skintones but somewhat ok for deeper skintones. 

Also I find the peachy tone to S1NGLE goes very well with my skin. "
Makeup,Anyone tried the Fenty Beauty Mattemoiselle Lipsticks?,I found that on the first try and then upon the second application i did not feel like this feeling continued. They’re just very creamy and all but they down matte perfectly the second time. 
Makeup,"I bought a foundation from Fenty Beauty in the shade 170, and then I ""randomly"" picked a concealer in the shade 230 testing it at the sephora shop cause i couldn't remember my foundation's shade number, now I'm not sure whether to change it cause everyone says they should match","Go back to Sephora and tell them the same thing. Bring the concealer and receipt. 

You can have them test your foundation shade with the concealer on your face if you want. "

In my case I chose a darker one lol plus I think it was a bit yellow-ish for my skin and this is also the mistake I've made with my last concealer. Anyway I went back to sephora with my check and changed it

Unless they're really busy Sephora staff are usually more than happy to help with stuff like that.
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"Foundations are such a personal thing. Having such sensitive skin, I would suggest asking for a sample from Sephora...if you have one nearby."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"I got a sample last Friday of the primer and foundation. I’ve got sensitive skin, a bit of rosacea, and my t-zone is oily but normal everywhere else. 

I love love love the foundation, it stays on so well and lasts through my very sweaty shifts as a server better than anything I’ve tried so far.

The primer for me did not work in any way. My drugstore Maybelliene primer actually worked way better with it. 

When Sephora has my shade of foundation back in stock I’m getting some and I’m getting a matchstick trio as well, because the colours look ah-may-zing and I’m just excited to try them!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"I want to try the foundation, but haven't yet. I like that her range tried to include both light and dark shades, it's almost like the company did market research before release!"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"Apparently if your skin is dry, you should stay away... 
she will release an update don't worry, don't fret."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"What is your skin type (dry, oily...)?"
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"Very dry, unfortunately."
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"Then I wouldn't recommend Fenty at all!! As for the Too Faced BTW, I find that it clings to my dry patches and looks a bit cakey. "
Makeup,Fenty Beauty???,"I don't know if you've tried Maybelline FitMe, but I'd recommend the Dewy+Smooth line. If you have, then No7? They have three different lines, you'd probably not be the Matte because it's for oily skin. Or Neutrogena! "
Makeup,Has anyone tried the new Fenty Beauty Holiday Collection?,"I wanted most of it before I started reading a lot of reviews and looking up swatches. Temptalia gave the eye+lip pencils pretty bad reviews (especially the one I really wanted, Frost Hunny) so I’m skipping those for sure. I still might get the highlighter palette since cardboard packaging doesn’t bother me and I love blue highlighters and copper pigments. Other than that, I’m not sure and like I mentioned, I haven’t tried anything personally yet. "
Makeup,Has anyone tried the new Fenty Beauty Holiday Collection?,"I got both lipstick sets - They are absolutely beautiful, although  I’m not sure when I’m going to use some of the colors simply because they’re a little out there. I normally focus on my eyes and put a lot of color and shimmer on my lids, so with such vibrant metallics on my lips, I feel like I have to tone down my eyes. Formulas and pigmentation are great though!"
Makeup,"Ok ladies, for those of you that have already tried Fenty Beauty.. do you think the brush or sponge provides better, even coverage? I usually have combination skin, but lately I have been a little more dry and am struggling a little with that.",Every tutorial I've seen shows much better coverage with the brush...i guess they can justify the price with it's usefulness!

The flat top fits right into my eye area.
